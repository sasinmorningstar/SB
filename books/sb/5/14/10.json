    "synonyms": "kvacit—sometimes; sakṛt—once; avagata-viṣaya-vaitathyaḥ—becoming conscious of the uselessness of enjoying material sense gratification; svayam—himself; para-abhidhyānena—by the bodily concept of the self; vibhraṁśita—destroyed; smṛtiḥ—whose remembrance; tayā—by that; eva—certainly; marīci-toya—water in a mirage; prāyān—similar to; tān—those sense objects; eva—certainly; abhidhāvati—runs after.",
    "translation": "The conditioned soul sometimes personally appreciates the futility of sense enjoyment in the material world, and he sometimes considers material enjoyment to be full of miseries. However, due to his strong bodily conception, his memory is destroyed, and again and again he runs after material enjoyment, just as an animal runs after a mirage in the desert.",

            "content": "The main disease in material life is the bodily conception. Being baffled again and again in material activity, the conditioned soul temporarily thinks of the futility of material enjoyment, but he again tries the same thing. By the association of devotees, a person may become convinced of the material futility, but he cannot give up his engagement, although he is very eager to return home, back to Godhead. Under these circumstances, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in everyone's heart, compassionately takes away all the material possessions of such a devotee. As stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam : āmi-vijña, ei mūrkhe 'viṣaya' kene diba. The Lord understands the devotee who hesitates to engage in the Lord's service, not knowing whether he should again try to revive his material life. After repeated attempts and failures, he fully surrenders to the lotus feet of the Lord. The Lord then gives him directions, and, attaining happiness, he forgets all material engagement."
