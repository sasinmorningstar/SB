One cannot inquire about transcendental subject matters from a layman. As stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam , bhaktyā mām abhijānāti: one must try to understand Kṛṣṇa by devotional service and from a devotee. Therefore Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja was quite right in wanting to learn further about Prahlāda Mahārāja from Śrī Nārada Muni."
