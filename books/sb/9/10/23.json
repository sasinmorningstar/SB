Upon seeing this, Rāvaṇa's followers raised a tumultuous sound, crying, \"Alas! Alas! What has happened? What has happened?\" as Rāvaṇa, vomiting blood from his ten mouths, fell from his airplane, just as a pious man falls to earth from the heavenly planets when the results of his pious activities are exhausted.",
