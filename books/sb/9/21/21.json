On the other hand, if one is born a vaiśya, by his activities he can become a brāhmaṇa. This is confirmed by Nārada Muni. Yasya yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktam. The members of the varṇas, or social orders-brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra-must be ascertained by their symptoms, not by birth. Birth is immaterial; quality is essential.\n"
