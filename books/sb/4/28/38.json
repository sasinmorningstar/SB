Actually, however, Parabrahman, the Supreme Brahman, is Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva. As stated in Bhagavad-gītā  therefore says, kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām: \"For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome.\" Consequently, when it is said herein that King Malayadhvaja fixed his mind on Brahman, \"Brahman\" means the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva.\n"
