    "synonyms": "hanyante—are killed in many ways (especially by slaughterhouses); paśavaḥ—four-legged animals (horses, sheep, cows, hogs, etc.); yatra—wherein; nirdayaiḥ—by those merciless persons who are conducted by the mode of passion; ajita-ātmabhiḥ—rascals who are unable to control the senses; manyamānaiḥ—are thinking; imam—this; deham—body; ajara—will never become old or diseased; amṛtyu—death will never come; naśvaram—although the body is destined to be annihilated.",
    "translation": "Unable to control their senses, rascals who are falsely proud of their riches or their birth in aristocratic families are so cruel that to maintain their perishable bodies, which they think will never grow old or die, they kill poor animals without mercy. Sometimes they kill animals merely to enjoy an excursion.",

Then, being mad, they maintain big slaughterhouses or occasionally go on pleasure excursions to kill animals. Forgetting that however one may try to maintain the body, the body is subject to birth, death, old age and disease, such foolish rascals engage in sinful activities, one after another. Being duṣkṛtīs, they completely forget the existence of the supreme controller, who is sitting within the core of everyone's heart (īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati ). In this way, sinful persons automatically receive punishment in different types of bodies. The root cause of this punishment is that when one unnecessarily accumulates wealth, one becomes more and more degraded, not knowing that his wealth will be finished with his next birth."

If one practices eating prasāda, even if there is some little sinful activity involved, one becomes free from the results of sinful acts."
