    "synonyms": "giram—a vibration of words; samādhau—in trance; gagane—in the sky; samīritām—vibrated; niśamya—hearing; vedhāḥ—Lord Brahmā; tridaśān—unto the demigods; uvāca—said; ha—oh; gām—the order; pauruṣīm—received from the Supreme Person; me—from me; śṛṇuta—just hear; amarāḥ—O demigods; punaḥ—again; vidhīyatām—execute; āśu—immediately; tathā eva—just so; mā—do not; ciram—delay.",
    "translation": "While in trance, Lord Brahmā heard the words of Lord Viṣṇu vibrating in the sky. Thus he told the demigods: O demigods, hear from me the order of Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, the Supreme Person, and execute it attentively without delay.",

            "content": "It appears that the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be heard in trance by competent persons. Modern science gives us telephones, by which one can hear sound vibrations from a distant place. Similarly, although other persons cannot hear the words of Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Brahmā is able to hear the Lord's words within himself. This is confirmed in the beginning of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam ). The causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is neglected by such demoniac persons, who cannot understand the instructions of Bhagavad-gītā and who therefore misinterpret them."
