The friends, relatives and well-wishers of both Nanda Mahārāja and Vasudeva and even those who externally appeared to be followers of Kaṁsa were all demigods.",

The Lord ordered all the denizens of the heavenly planets to take birth in different families of the Yadu and Vṛṣṇi dynasties and in Vṛndāvana. Now this verse informs us that all the family and friends of the Yadu dynasty, the Vṛṣṇi dynasty, Nanda Mahārāja and the gopas descended from the heavenly planets to see the pastimes of the Lord. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā , the Lord's pastimes consist of paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām—saving the devotees and killing the demons. To demonstrate these activities, the Lord called for devotees from different parts of the universe."
