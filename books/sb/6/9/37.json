    "synonyms": "sama—equal or proper; viṣama—and unequal or mistaken; matīnām—of those having intelligence; matam—conclusion; anusarasi—You follow; yathā—just as; rajju-khaṇḍaḥ—a piece of rope; sarpa-ādi—a snake, etc.; dhiyām—of those who perceive.",
    "translation": "A rope causes fear for a bewildered person who considers it a snake, but not for a person with proper intelligence who knows it to be only a rope. Similarly, You, as the Supersoul in everyone's heart, inspire fear or fearlessness according to one's intelligence, but in You there is no duality.",

The same Supreme Lord is a source of bliss to devotees and fear to nondevotees who have a poor fund of knowledge. God is one, but people understand the Absolute Truth from different angles of vision. The unintelligent see contradictions in Him, but sober devotees find no contradictions."
