    ],
    "synonyms": "eṣaḥ—this; prakṛti-saṅgena—because of association with the material nature; puruṣasya—of the living entity; viparyayaḥ—a situation of forgetfulness or an awkward position; āsīt—came to be; saḥ—that position; eva—indeed; na—not; cirāt—taking a long time; īśa-saṅgāt—from the association of the Supreme Lord; vilīyate—is vanquished.",
    "translation": "Since the living entity is associated with material nature, he is in an awkward position, but if in the human form of life he is taught how to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee, this position can be overcome.",

            "content": "The word prakṛti means material nature, and puruṣa may also refer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one wants to continue his association with prakṛti, the female energy of Kṛṣṇa, and be separated from Kṛṣṇa by the illusion that he is able to enjoy prakṛti, he must continue in his conditional life. If he changes his consciousness, however, and associates with the supreme, original person (puruṣaṁ śāśvatam), or with His associates, he can get out of the entanglement of material nature. As confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā )."
