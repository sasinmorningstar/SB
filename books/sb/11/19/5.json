Every living entity has an eternal spiritual form, which lies dormant until one arouses one's original Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Without knowledge of one's own spiritual personality it is not possible to cultivate love of the Supreme Personality, Lord Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, the words jñātvā svātmānam are significant here, indicating that every living entity can realize his full potential as an individual person only in the kingdom of God.\n"
