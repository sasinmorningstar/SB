    "synonyms": "sarveṣu—in all; śaśvat—eternally; tanu-bhṛtsu—embodied living beings; avasthitam—situated; yathā—just as; kham—the sky; ātmānam—the Supreme Soul; abhīṣṭam—most worshipable; īśvaram—ultimate controller; veda-upagītam—glorified by the Vedas; ca—also; na śṛṇvate—they do not hear; abudhāḥ—unintelligent persons; manaḥ-rathānām—of whimsical pleasures; pravadanti—they go on discussing; vārtayā—the topics.",
    "translation": "The Personality of Godhead is eternally situated within the heart of every embodied being; still the Lord remains situated apart, just as the sky, which is all-pervading, does not mix with any material object. Thus the Lord is the supreme worshipable object and the absolute controller of everything. He is elaborately glorified in the Vedic literature, but those who are bereft of intelligence do not like to hear about Him. They prefer to waste their time discussing their own mental concoctions, which inevitably deal with gross material sense gratification such as sex life and meat-eating.",

Instead, such sense gratifiers consider themselves to be most eloquent and learned. Every materialistic person actually feels that he is the most intelligent person, and thus he has no time to hear the actual truth. Nevertheless, the Personality of Godhead, as described in this verse, waits patiently within the heart of the conditioned soul, encouraging him to recognize the Lord, who is sitting beside him. Such recognition of the Personality of Godhead is the beginning of all auspiciousness and happiness for the conditioned soul."
