Therefore a compromise was selected by Arjuna by his sharp intelligenceand he separated the jewel from the head of Aśvatthāmā. This was as good as cutting off his headand yet his life was saved for all practical purposes. Here Aśvatthāmā is indicated as twice-born. Certainly he was twice-bornbut he fell down from his positionand therefore he was properly punished."
