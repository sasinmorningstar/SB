            "text": "Dhanur-vedaor military sciencewas taught by Droṇācārya with all its confidential secrets of throwing and controlling by Vedic hymns. Gross military science is dependent on material weaponsbut finer than that is the art of throwing the arrows saturated with Vedic hymnswhich act more effectively than gross material weapons like machine guns or atomic bombs. The control is by Vedic mantrasor the transcendental science of sound. It is said in the Rāmāyaṇa that Mahārāja Daśarathathe father of Lord Śrī Rāmaused to control arrows by sound only. He could pierce his target with his arrow by only hearing the soundwithout seeing the object. So this is a finer military science than that of the gross material military weapons used nowadays. Arjuna was taught all thisand therefore Draupadī wished that Arjuna feel obliged to Ācārya Droṇa for all these benefits. And in the absence of Droṇācāryahis son was his representative. That was the opinion of the good lady Draupadī. It may be argued why Droṇācāryaa rigid brāhmaṇashould be a teacher in military science. But the reply is that a brāhmaṇa should become a teacherregardless of what his department of knowledge is. A learned brāhmaṇa should become a teachera priest and a recipient of charity. A bona fide brāhmaṇa is authorized to accept such professions."
