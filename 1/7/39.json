Although he joined the enemy campthe Pāṇḍavas held him always in respectand Arjuna saluted him before beginning the fight. There was nothing wrong in that way. But the son of Droṇācārya degraded himself by committing acts which are never done by the dvijasor the twice-born higher castes. Aśvatthāmāthe son of Droṇācāryacommitted murder by killing the five sleeping sons of Draupadīby which he dissatisfied his master Duryodhanawho never approved of the heinous act of killing the five sleeping sons of the Pāṇḍavas. This means that Aśvatthāmā became an assaulter of Arjuna's own family membersand thus he was liable to be punished by him. In the śāstrashe who attacks without notice or kills from behind or sets fire to another's house or kidnaps one's wife is condemned to death. Kṛṣṇa reminded Arjuna of these facts so that he might take notice of them and do the needful."
