He sawthereforeHis different energiesnamely the internal energythe marginal energy and the external energy. He also saw His different plenary portions and parts of the plenary portionsnamely His different incarnations alsoand he specifically observed the unwanted miseries of the conditioned soulswho are bewildered by the external energy. And at last he saw the remedial measure for the conditioned soulsnamelythe process of devotional service. It is a great transcendental science and begins with the process of hearing and chanting the namefamegloryetc.of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Revival of the dormant affection or love of Godhead does not depend on the mechanical system of hearing and chantingbut it solely and wholly depends on the causeless mercy of the Lord. When the Lord is fully satisfied with the sincere efforts of the devoteeHe may endow him with His loving transcendental service. But even with the prescribed forms of hearing and chantingthere is at once mitigation of the superfluous and unwanted miseries of material existence. Such mitigation of material affection does not wait for development of transcendental knowledge. Ratherknowledge is dependent on devotional service for the ultimate realization of the Supreme Truth."
