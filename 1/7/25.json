The Lord is everyone's father. No one can be His fatherand yet no one can be His son. His devotees are His kinsmenand His devotees are His relations. This is His transcendental pastime. It has nothing to do with mundane ideas of relationsfatherhood or anything like that. As mentioned abovethe Lord is above the modes of material natureand thus there is nothing mundane about His kinsmen and relations in devotional service."
