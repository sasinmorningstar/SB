            "text": "The theory that the modern atomic bomb explosions can annihilate the world is childish imagination. First of allthe atomic energy is not powerful enough to destroy the world. And secondlyultimately it all rests on the supreme will of the Supreme Lord because without His will or sanction nothing can be built up or destroyed. It is foolish also to think that natural laws are ultimately powerful. Material nature's law works under the direction of the Lordas confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā. The Lord says there that natural laws work under His supervision. The world can be destroyed only by the will of the Lord and not by the whims of tiny politicians. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa desired that the weapons released by both Drauṇi and Arjuna be withdrawnand it was carried out by Arjuna at once. Similarlythere are many agents of the all-powerful Lordand by His will only can one execute what He desires."
