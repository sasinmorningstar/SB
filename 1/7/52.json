            "text": "Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa had two armsand why He is designated as four-armed is explained by Śrīdhara Svāmī. Both Bhīma and Draupadī held opposite views about killing Aśvatthāmā. Bhīma wanted him to be immediately killedwhereas Draupadī wanted to save him. We can imagine Bhīma ready to kill while Draupadī is obstructing him. And in order to prevent both of themthe Lord discovered another two arms. Originallythe primeval Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa displays only two armsbut in His Nārāyaṇa feature He exhibits four. In His Nārāyaṇa feature He resides with His devotees in the Vaikuṇṭha planetswhile in His original Śrī Kṛṣṇa feature He resides in the Kṛṣṇaloka planet farfar above the Vaikuṇṭha planets in the spiritual sky. Thereforeif Śrī Kṛṣṇa is called caturbhujaḥthere is no contradiction. If need be He can display hundreds of armsas He exhibited in His viśva-rūpa shown to Arjuna. Thereforeone who can display hundreds and thousands of arms can also manifest four whenever needed."
