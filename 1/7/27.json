            "text": "The brahmāstra is similar to the modern nuclear weapon manipulated by atomic energy. The atomic energy works wholly on total combustibilityand so the brahmāstra also acts. It creates an intolerable heat similar to atomic radiationbut the difference is that the atomic bomb is a gross type of nuclear weaponwhereas the brahmāstra is a subtle type of weapon produced by chanting hymns. It is a different scienceand in the days gone by such science was cultivated in the land of Bhārata-varṣa. The subtle science of chanting hymns is also materialbut it has yet to be known by the modern material scientists. Subtle material science is not spiritualbut it has a direct relationship with the spiritual methodwhich is still subtler. A chanter of hymns knew how to apply the weapon as well as how to retract it. That was perfect knowledge. But the son of Droṇācāryawho made use of this subtle sciencedid not know how to retract. He applied itbeing afraid of his imminent deathand thus the practice was not only improper but also irreligious. As the son of a brāhmaṇahe should not have made so many mistakesand for such gross negligence of duty he was to be punished by the Lord Himself."
