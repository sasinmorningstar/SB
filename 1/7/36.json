Formerly battles were fought on the principles of religion and not for the sake of sense gratification. If the enemy happened to be intoxicatedasleepetc.as above mentionedhe was never to be killed. These are some of the codes of religious war. Formerly war was never declared by the whims of selfish political leaders; it was carried out on religious principles free from all vices. Violence carried out on religious principles is far superior to so-called nonviolence."
