Kṛṣṇa also knew him to be sobut both of them condemned the murderer without consideration of his being the son of a brāhmaṇa. According to revealed scripturesa teacher or spiritual master is liable to be rejected if he proves himself unworthy of the position of a guru or spiritual master. A guru is called also an ācāryaor a person who has personally assimilated all the essence of śāstras and has helped his disciples to adopt the ways. Aśvatthāmā failed to discharge the duties of a brāhmaṇa or teacherand therefore he was liable to be rejected from the exalted position of a brāhmaṇa. On this considerationboth Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were right in condemning Aśvatthāmā. But to a good lady like Draupadīthe matter was considered not from the angle of śāstric visionbut as a matter of custom. By customAśvatthāmā was offered the same respect as offered to his father. It was so because generally the people accept the son of a brāhmaṇa as a real brāhmaṇaby sentiment only. Factually the matter is different. A brāhmaṇa is accepted on the merit of qualification and not on the merit of simply being the son of a brāhmaṇa."

This means that a devotee of the Lord can tolerate all sorts of tribulation personallybut still such devotees are never unkind to otherseven to the enemy. These are the characteristics of one who is a pure devotee of the Lord."
