The word dvijātmajaḥ is significant here because Aśvatthāmāalthough the son of Droṇācāryawas not exactly a qualified brāhmaṇa. The most intelligent man is called a brāhmaṇaand it is not a hereditary title. Aśvatthāmā was also formerly called the brahma-bandhuor the friend of a brāhmaṇa. Being a friend of a brāhmaṇa does not mean that one is a brāhmaṇa by qualification. A friend or son of a brāhmaṇawhen fully qualifiedcan be called a brāhmaṇa and not otherwise. Since Aśvatthāmā's decision is immaturehe is purposely called herein the son of a brāhmaṇa."
