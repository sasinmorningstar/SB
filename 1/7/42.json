Due to her female nature, and due to her being naturally good and well-behaved, she showed him due respects as a brāhmaṇa.\n\n",

But when he was brought before Śrīmatī Draupadīshealthough begrieved for the murder of her sonsand although the murderer was present before hercould not withdraw the due respect generally offered to a brāhmaṇa or to the son of a brāhmaṇa. This is due to her mild nature as a woman. Women as a class are no better than boysand therefore they have no discriminatory power like that of a man. Aśvatthāmā proved himself to be an unworthy son of Droṇācārya or of a brāhmaṇaand for this reason he was condemned by the greatest authorityLord Śrī Kṛṣṇaand yet a mild woman could not withdraw her natural courtesy for a brāhmaṇa."

Butanywaywe should not give up our reason and discriminatory power just to be gentle. One must have good discriminatory power to judge a thing on its merit. We should not follow the mild nature of a woman and thereby accept that which is not genuine. Aśvatthāmā may be respected by a good-natured womanbut that does not mean that he is as good as a genuine brāhmaṇa."
