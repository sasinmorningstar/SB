It is nothing compared with the ocean of bliss of the vision of the Personality of Godhead.

There is no need of logical arguments in support of this statementbut out of one's own nature one becomes attracted by the qualities of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. We must know for certain that the qualities of the Lord have nothing to do with mundane qualities. All of them are full of blissknowledge and eternity.
