Without self-realizationphilosophy is dry speculation or a waste of time and energy. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam gives the right knowledge of one's own selfand by hearing Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam one can get free from material attachment and enter into the kingdom of fearlessness. This material world is fearfulness. Its prisoners are always fearful as within a prison house. In the prison house no one can violate the jail rules and regulationsand violating the rules means another term for extension of prison life. Similarlywe in this material existence are always fearful. This fearfulness is called anxiety. Everyone in the material lifein all species and varieties of lifeis full of anxietieseither by breaking or without breaking the laws of nature. Liberationor muktimeans getting relief from these constant anxieties. This is possible only when the anxiety is changed to the devotional service of the Lord. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam gives us the chance to change the quality of anxiety from matter to spirit. This is done in the association of a learned philosopher like the self-realized Śukadeva Gosvāmīthe great son of Śrī Vyāsadeva. Mahārāja Parīkṣitafter receiving warning of his deathtook advantage of this opportunity by association with Śukadeva Gosvāmī and achieved the desired result."

Such imitative hearing of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is a caricature onlyand one should not be misled by such a performance of bhāgavatam saptāha undertaken by ridiculous greedy fellows to maintain an establishment of material enjoyment."
