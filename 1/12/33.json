He was the son of Mahārāja Avikṣit and was a great devotee of the son of the sun-godknown as Yamarāja. His brother Samvarta was a rival priest of the great Bṛhaspatithe learned priest of the demigods. He conducted one sacrifice called Saṅkāra-yajña by which the Lord was so satisfied that He was pleased to hand over to him the charge of a mountain peak of gold. This peak of gold is somewhere in the Himalaya Mountainsand modern adventurers may try to find it there. He was so powerful an emperor that at the day's end of sacrificethe demigods from the other planets like IndraCandra and Bṛhaspati used to visit his palace. And because he had the gold peak at his disposalhe had sufficient gold in his possession. The canopy of the sacrificial altar was completely made of gold. in his daily performances of the sacrificial ceremoniessome of the inhabitants of the Vāyuloka (airy planets) were invited to expedite the cooking work of the ceremony. And the assembly of the demigods in the ceremony was led by Viśvadeva."

Because of munificent charities and performances of innumerable sacrificesthe King of heavenIndradevawas fully satisfied with him and always wished for his welfare. Due to his pious activitieshe remained a young man throughout his life and reigned over the world for one thousand yearssurrounded by his satisfied subjectsministerslegitimate wifesons and brothers. Even Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa praised his spirit of pious activities. He handed over his only daughter to Maharṣi Aṅgirāand by his good blessingshe was elevated to the kingdom of heaven. First of allhe wanted to offer the priesthood of his sacrifices to learned Bṛhaspatibut the demigod refused to accept the post because of the King's being a human beinga man of this earth. He was very sorry for thisbut on the advice of Nārada Muni he appointed Samvarta to the postand he was successful in his mission."
