            "text": "Child Parīkṣit was not observing a living being who is limited by time and space. There is a gulf of difference between the Lord and the individual living being. The Lord is mentioned herein as the supreme living being unlimited by time and space. Every living being is limited by time and space. Even though a living being is qualitatively one with the Lordquantitatively there is a great difference between the Supreme Soul and the common individual soul. In the Bhagavad-gītā both the living beings and the Supreme Being are said to be all-pervading (yena sarvam idaṁ tatam)yet there is a difference between these two kinds of all-pervasiveness. A common living being or soul can be all-pervading within his own limited bodybut the supreme living being is all-pervading in all space and all time. A common living being cannot extend its influence over another common living being by its all-pervasivenessbut the Supreme Supersoulthe Personality of Godheadis unlimitedly able to exert His influence over all places and all times and over all living beings. And because He is all-pervasiveunlimited by time and spaceHe can appear even within the womb of the mother of child Parīkṣit. He is mentioned herein as the protector of the righteous. Anyone who is a surrendered soul unto the Supreme is righteousand he is specifically protected by the Lord in all circumstances. The Lord is the indirect protector of the unrighteous alsofor He rectifies their sins through His external potency. The Lord is mentioned herein as one who is dressed in the ten directions. This means dressed with garments on ten sidesup and down. He is present everywhere and can appear and disappear at His will from everywhere and anywhere. His disappearance from the sight of the child Parīkṣit does not mean that He appeared on the spot from any other place. He was present thereand even after His disappearance He was therealthough invisible to the eyes of the child. This material covering of the effulgent firmament is also something like a womb of the mother natureand we are all put into the womb by the Lordthe father of all living beings. He is present everywhereeven in this material womb of mother Durgāand those who are deserving can see the Lord."
