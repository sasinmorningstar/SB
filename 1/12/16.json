            "text": "The child Parīkṣit was saved by the all-powerful and all-pervasive Viṣṇu (Lord Kṛṣṇa) for two reasons. The first reason is that the child in the womb of his mother was spotless due to his being a pure devotee of the Lord. The second reason is that the child was the only surviving male descendant of Puruthe pious forefather of the virtuous King Yudhiṣṭhira. The Lord wants to continue the line of pious kings to rule over the earth as His representatives for the actual progress of a peaceful and prosperous life. After the Battle of Kurukṣetraeven up to the next generation of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was annihilatedand there were none who could generate another son in the great royal family. Mahārāja Parīkṣitthe son of Abhimanyuwas the only surviving heir apparent in the familyand by the irresistible supernatural brahmāstra weapon of Aśvatthāmāhe was forced to be annihilated. Lord Kṛṣṇa is described herein as Viṣṇuand this is also significant. Lord Kṛṣṇathe original Personality of Godheaddoes the work of protection and annihilation in His capacity of Viṣṇu. Lord Viṣṇu is the plenary expansion of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The all-pervasive activities of the Lord are executed by Him in His Viṣṇu feature. Child Parīkṣit is described here as spotlessly white because he is an unalloyed devotee of the Lord. Such unalloyed devotees of the Lord appear on the earth just to execute the mission of the Lord. The Lord desires the conditioned souls hovering in the material creation to be reclaimed to go back homeback to Godheadand thus He helps them by preparing the transcendental literatures like the Vedasby sending missionaries of saints and sages and by deputing His representativethe spiritual master. Such transcendental literaturesmissionaries and representatives of the Lord are spotlessly white because the contamination of the material qualities cannot even touch them. They are always protected by the Lord when they are threatened with annihilation. Such foolish threats are made by the gross materialists. The brahmāstrawhich was thrown by Aśvatthāmā at the child Parīkṣitwas certainly supernaturally powerfuland nothing of the material world could resist its force of penetration. But the all-powerful Lordwho is present everywherewithin and withoutcould counteract it by His all-powerful potency just to save a bona fide servant of the Lord and descendant of another devoteeMahārāja Yudhiṣṭhirawho was always obliged by the Lord by His causeless mercy."
