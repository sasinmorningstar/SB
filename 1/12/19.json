            "text": "Prajā means the living being who has taken his birth in the material world. Actually the living being has no birth and no deathbut because of his separation from the service of the Lord and due to his desire to lord it over material naturehe is offered a suitable body to satisfy his material desires. In doing soone becomes conditioned by the laws of material natureand the material body is changed in terms of his own work. The living entity thus transmigrates from one body to another in 8,400,000 species of life. But due to his being the part and parcel of the Lordhe not only is maintained with all necessaries of life by the Lordbut also is protected by the Lord and His representativesthe saintly kings. These saintly kings give protection to all the prajāsor living beingsto live and to fulfill their terms of imprisonment. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was actually an ideal saintly king because while touring his kingdom he happened to see that a poor cow was about to be killed by the personified Kaliwhom he at once took to task as a murderer. This means that even the animals were given protection by the saintly administratorsnot from any sentimental point of viewbut because those who have taken their birth in the material world have the right to live. All the saintly kingsbeginning from the King of the sun globe down to the King of the earthare so inclined by the influence of the Vedic literatures. The Vedic literatures are taught in higher planets alsoas there is reference in the Bhagavad-gītā  about the teachings to the sun-god (Vivasvān) by the Lordand such lessons are transferred by disciplic successionas it was done by the sun-god to his son Manuand from Manu to Mahārāja Ikṣvāku. There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahmāand the Manu referred to herein is the seventh Manuwho is one of the prajāpatis (those who create progeny)and he is the son of the sun-god. He is known as the Vaivasvata Manu. He had ten sonsand Mahārāja Ikṣvāku is one of them. Mahārāja Ikṣvāku also learned bhakti-yoga as taught in the Bhagavad-gītā from his fatherManuwho got it from his fatherthe sun-god. Later on the teaching of the Bhagavad-gītā came down by disciplic succession from Mahārāja Ikṣvākubut in course of time the chain was broken by unscrupulous personsand therefore it again had to be taught to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra. So all the Vedic literatures are current from the very beginning of creation of the material worldand thus the Vedic literatures are known as apauruṣeya (not made by man). The Vedic knowledge was spoken by the Lord and first heard by Brahmāthe first created living being within the universe."

In the month of Caitra on the ninth day of the growing moon in the Tretā-yugathe Lord appearedas usualto establish the principles of religion and to annihilate the disturbing elements. When He was just a young boyHe helped the great sage Viśvāmitra by killing Subahu and striking Mārīcathe she-demonwho was disturbing the sages in their daily discharge of duties. The brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas are meant to cooperate for the welfare of the mass of people. The brāhmaṇa sages endeavor to enlighten the people by perfect knowledgeand the kṣatriyas are meant for their protection. Lord Rāmacandra is the ideal king for maintaining and protecting the highest culture of humanityknown as brahmaṇya-dharma. The Lord is specifically the protector of the cows and the brāhmaṇasand hence He enhances the prosperity of the world. He rewarded the administrative demigods by effective weapons to conquer the demons through the agency of Viśvāmitra. He was present in the bow sacrifice of King Janakaand by breaking the invincible bow of ŚivaHe married Sītādevīdaughter of Mahārāja Janaka."
