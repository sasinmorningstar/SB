            "text": "Death generally involves remaining in trance for seven months. A living beingaccording to his own actionis allowed to enter into the womb of a mother by the vehicle of a father's seminaand thus he develops his desired body. This is the law of birth in specific bodies according to one's past actions. When he is awake from trancehe feels the inconvenience of being confined within the womband thus he wants to come out of it and sometimes fortunately prays to the Lord for such liberation. Mahārāja Parīkṣitwhile in the womb of his motherwas struck by the brahmāstra released by Aśvatthāmāand he was feeling the burning heat. But because he was a devotee of the Lordthe Lord at once appeared Himself within the womb by His all-powerful energyand the child could see that someone else had come to save him. Even in that helpless conditionthe child Parīkṣit endured the unbearable temperature due to his being a great fighter by nature. And for this reason the word vīraḥ has been used."
