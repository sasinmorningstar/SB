Mahārāja Parīkṣit was saved by the Lord in the womb of his motherso he could certainly be saved from an untimely death due to the ill will of the son of a brāhmaṇa. Because the age of Kali began to act just after the assumption of power by Mahārāja Parīkṣitthe first sign of misgivings was exhibited in the cursing of such a greatly intelligent and devoted king as Mahārāja Parīkṣit. The king is the protector of the helpless citizensand their welfarepeace and prosperity depend on him. Unfortunatelyby the instigation of the fallen age of Kalian unfortunate brāhmaṇa's son was employed to condemn the innocent Mahārāja Parīkṣitand so the King had to prepare himself for death within seven days. Mahārāja Parīkṣit is especially famous as one who is protected by Viṣṇuand when he was unduly cursed by a brāhmaṇa's sonhe could have invoked the mercy of the Lord to save himbut he did not want to because he was a pure devotee. A pure devotee never asks the Lord for any undue favor. Mahārāja Parīkṣit knew that the curse of the brāhmaṇa's son upon him was unjustifiedas everyone else knewbut he did not want to counteract it because he knew also that the age of Kali had begun and that the first symptom of the agenamely degradation of the highly talented brāhmaṇa communityhad also begun. He did not want to interfere with the current of the timebut he prepared himself to meet death very cheerfully and very properly. Being fortunatehe got at least seven days to prepare himself to meet deathand so he properly utilized the time in the association of Śukadeva Gosvāmīthe great saint and devotee of the Lord."
