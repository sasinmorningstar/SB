            "text": "Śukadeva Gosvāmī imparted transcendental knowledge to Mahārāja Parīkṣit during the remaining seven days of his lifeand Mahārāja Parīkṣit heard him properlyjust like an ardent student. The effect of such a bona fide hearing and chanting of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam was equally shared by both the hearer and the chanter. Both of them were benefited. Out of the nine different transcendental means of devotional service to the Lord prescribed in the Bhāgavatameither all of themor some of them or even one of them are equally beneficial if properly discharged. Mahārāja Parīkṣit and Śukadeva Gosvāmī were serious performers of the first two important itemsnamely the process of chanting and the process of hearingand therefore both of them were successful in their laudable attempt. Transcendental realization is attained by such serious hearing and chanting and not otherwise. There is a type of spiritual master and disciple much advertised in this age of Kali. It is said that the master injects spiritual force into the disciple by an electrical current generated by the masterand the disciple begins to feel the shock. He becomes unconsciousand the master weeps for his exhausting his store of so-called spiritual assets. Such bogus advertisement is going on in this ageand the poor common man is becoming the victim of such advertisement. We do not find such folk tales in the dealings of Śukadeva Gosvāmī and his great disciple Mahārāja Parīkṣit. The sage recited Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in devotionand the great King heard him properly. The King did not feel any shock of electrical current from the masternor did he become unconscious while receiving knowledge from the master. One should notthereforebecome a victim of these unauthorized advertisements made by some bogus representative of Vedic knowledge. The sages of Naimiṣāraṇya were very respectful in hearing about Mahārāja Parīkṣit because of his receiving knowledge from Śukadeva Gosvāmī by means of ardent hearing. Ardent hearing from the bona fide master is the only way to receive transcendental knowledgeand there is no need for medical performances or occult mysticism for miraculous effects. The process is simplebut only the sincere party can achieve the desired result."
