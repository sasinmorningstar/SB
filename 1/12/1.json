His arrival at Dvārakā and residing with the sixteen thousand queensetc.were narrated. The sages were absorbed in hearing such descriptionsbut now they wanted to turn to the original topicand thus the inquiry was made by Śaunaka Ṛṣi. So the subject of the release of the brahmāstra weapon by Aśvatthāmā is renewed."
