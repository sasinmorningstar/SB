            "text": "Material attachment and taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord go ill together. Material attachment means ignorance of transcendental happiness under the shelter of the Lord. Devotional service to the Lordwhile existing in the material worldis a way to practice one's transcendental relation with the Lordand when it is maturedone gets completely free from all material attachment and becomes competent to go back homeback to Godhead. Mahārāja Parīkṣitbeing especially attached to the Lord from the beginning of his body in the womb of his motherwas continuously under the shelter of the Lordand the so-called warning of his death within seven days from the date of the curse by the brāhmaṇa's son was a boon to him to enable him to prepare himself to go back homeback to Godhead. Since he was always protected by the Lordhe could have avoided the effect of such a curse by the grace of the Lordbut he did not take such undue advantage for nothing. Ratherhe made the best use of a bad bargain. For seven days continuously he heard Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam from the right sourceand thus he got shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord by that opportunity."
