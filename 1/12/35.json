Simply taking birth in the family of a brāhmaṇa does not make one qualified to perform yajñas. One must be twice-born by proper training and initiation from the bona fide ācārya. The once-born scions of brāhmaṇa families are equal with the once-born śūdrasand such brahma-bandhusor unqualified once-born scionsmust be rejected for any purpose of religious or Vedic function. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was entrusted to look after this arrangementand perfect as He isHe caused the yajñas to be performed by the bona fide twice-born brāhmaṇas for successful execution."
