            "text": "Astronomical calculations of stellar influences upon a living being are not suppositionsbut are factualas confirmed in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Every living being is controlled by the laws of nature at every minutejust as a citizen is controlled by the influence of the state. The state laws are grossly observedbut the laws of material naturebeing subtle to our gross understandingcannot be experienced grossly. As stated in the Bhagavad-gītā every action of life produces another reactionwhich is binding upon usand only those who are acting on behalf of Yajña (Viṣṇu) are not bound by reactions. Our actions are judged by the higher authoritiesthe agents of the Lordand thus we are awarded bodies according to our activities. The law of nature is so subtle that every part of our body is influenced by the respective starsand a living being obtains his working body to fulfill his terms of imprisonment by the manipulation of such astronomical influence. A man's destiny is therefore ascertained by the birthtime constellation of starsand a factual horoscope is made by a learned astrologer. It is a great scienceand misuse of a science does not make it useless. Mahārāja Parīkṣit or even the Personality of Godhead appear in certain constellations of good starsand thus the influence is exerted upon the body thus born at an auspicious moment. The most auspicious constellation of stars takes place during the appearance of the Lord in this material worldand it is specifically called jayantīa word not to be abused for any other purposes. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was not only a great kṣatriya emperorbut also a great devotee of the Lord. Thus he cannot take his birth at any inauspicious moment. As a proper place and time is selected to receive a respectable personageso also to receive such a personality as Mahārāja Parīkṣitwho was especially cared for by the Supreme Lorda suitable moment is chosen when all good stars assembled together to exert their influence upon the King. Thus he took his birth just to be known as the great hero of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. This suitable arrangement of astral influences is never a creation of man's willbut is the arrangement of the superior management of the agency of the Supreme Lord. Of coursethe arrangement is made according to the good or bad deeds of the living being. Herein lies the importance of pious acts performed by the living being. Only by pious acts can one be allowed to get good wealthgood education and beautiful features. The saṁskāras of the school of sanātana-dharma (man's eternal engagement) are highly suitable for creating an atmosphere for taking advantage of good stellar influencesand therefore garbhādhāna-saṁskāraor the first seedling purificatory process prescribed for the higher castesis the beginning of all pious acts to receive a good pious and intelligent class of men in human society. There will be peace and prosperity in the world due to good and sane population only; there is hell and disturbance only because of the unwantedinsane populace addicted to sex indulgence."
