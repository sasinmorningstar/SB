He therefore took all the responsibility for sins committed in the warfareand to get rid of all these sinshe wanted to perform three sacrifices in which horses are offered at the altar. Such a sacrifice is very costly. Even Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira had to collect the necessary heaps of gold left by Mahārāja Marutta and the brāhmaṇas who were given gold in charity by King Marutta. The learned brāhmaṇas could not take away all the loads of gold given by Mahārāja Maruttaand therefore they left behind the major portion of the gift. And Mahārāja Marutta also did not again collect such heaps of gold given away in charity. Besides thatall the golden plates and utensils which were used in the sacrifice were also thrown in the dustbinsand all such heaps of gold remained unclaimed property for a long timetill Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira collected them for his own purposes. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa advised the brothers of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to collect the unclaimed property because it belonged to the King. The more astonishing thing is that no subject of the state also collected such unclaimed gold for industrial enterprise or anything like that. This means that the state citizens were completely satisfied with all necessities of life and therefore not inclined to accept unnecessary productive enterprises for sense gratification. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira also requisitioned the heaps of gold for performing sacrifices and for pleasing the Supreme Hari Personality of Godhead. Otherwise he had no desire to collect them for the state treasury."

This indicates that unintentional sins are also committed in our daily occupational discharge of dutiesand to counteract even such unintentional crimesone must perform sacrifices as they are recommended in the revealed scriptures. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gītā (yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ ) that one must perform sacrifices recommended in the scriptures in order to get rid of commitments of all unauthorized workor even unintentional crimes which we are apt to commit. By doing soone shall be freed from all kinds of sins. And those who do not do so but work for self-interest or sense gratification have to undergo all tribulations accrued from committed sins. Thereforethe main purpose of performing sacrifices is to satisfy the Supreme Personality Hari. The process of performing sacrifices may be different in terms of different timesplaces and personsbut the aim of such sacrifices is one and the same at all times and in all circumstancesviz. satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Hari. That is the way of pious lifeand that is the way of peace and prosperity in the world at large. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira did all these as the ideal pious king in the world."

By doing so one can be freed from all sins and thus can attain the highest perfection of life by returning homeback to Godhead. We have already discussed this more than once in this great literature in different placesespecially in the introductory portion by sketching the life of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhuand still we are repeating the same with a view to bring about peace and prosperity in society."
