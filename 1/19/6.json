    "translation": "\nThe river [Ganges, by which the King sat to fast] carries the most auspicious water, which is mixed with the dust of the lotus feet of the Lord and tulasī leaves. Therefore that water sanctifies the three worlds inside and outside and even sanctifies Lord Śiva and other demigods. Consequently everyone who is destined to die must take shelter of this river.\n\n",

            "text": "Mahārāja Parīkṣitjust after receiving the news of his death within seven daysat once retired from family life and shifted himself to the sacred bank of the Yamunā River. Generally it is said that the King took shelter on the bank of the Gangesbut according to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmīthe King took shelter on the bank of the Yamunā. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī's statement appears to be more accurate because of the geographical situation. Mahārāja Parīkṣit resided in his capital Hastināpurasituated near present Delhiand the River Yamunā flows down past the city. Naturally the King would take shelter of the River Yamunā because she was flowing past his palace door. And as far as sanctity is concernedthe River Yamunā is more directly connected with Lord Kṛṣṇa than the Ganges. The Lord sanctified the River Yamunā from the beginning of His transcendental pastimes in the world. While His father Vasudeva was crossing the Yamunā with the baby Lord Kṛṣṇa for a safe place at Gokula on the other bank of the river from Mathurāthe Lord fell down in the riverand by the dust of His lotus feet the river at once became sanctified. It is especially mentioned herein that Mahārāja Parīkṣit took shelter of that particular river which is beautifully flowingcarrying the dust of the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇamixed with tulasī leaves. Lord Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet are always besmeared with the tulasī leavesand thus as soon as His lotus feet contact the water of the Ganges and the Yamunāthe rivers become at once sanctified. The Lordhowevercontacted the River Yamunā more than the Ganges. According to the Varāha Purāṇaas quoted by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmīthere is no difference between the water of the Ganges and the Yamunābut when the water of the Ganges is sanctified one hundred timesit is called the Yamunā. Similarlyit is said in the scriptures that one thousand names of Viṣṇu are equal to one name of Rāmaand three names of Lord Rāma are equal to one name of Kṛṣṇa."
