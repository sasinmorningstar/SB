            "text": "Saintly devotees like Śukadeva Gosvāmī generally do not approach worldly enjoyersespecially those in royal orders. Mahārāja Pratāparudra was a follower of Lord Caitanyabut when he wanted to see the Lordthe Lord refused to see him because he was a king. For a devotee who desires to go back to Godheadtwo things are strictly prohibited: worldly enjoyers and women. Thereforedevotees of the standard of Śukadeva Gosvāmī are never interested in seeing kings. Mahārāja Parīkṣit wasof coursea different case. He was a great devoteealthough a kingand therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī came to see him in his last stage of life. Mahārāja Parīkṣitout of his devotional humilityfelt himself an unworthy descendant of his great kṣatriya forefathersalthough he was as great as his predecessors. The unworthy sons of the royal orders are called kṣatra-bandhavasas the unworthy sons of the brāhmaṇas are called dvija-bandhus or brahma-bandhus. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was greatly encouraged by the presence of Śukadeva Gosvāmī. He felt himself sanctified by the presence of the great saint whose presence turns any place into a place of pilgrimage."
