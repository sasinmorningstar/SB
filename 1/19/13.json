Attached bathroomsurinalsetc. may be very convenient amenities of modern civilizationbut they are ordered to be situated at a distance from residential quarters. That very example is cited herein in relation to the kingly order for those who are progressively marching back to Godhead. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that to be in intimate touch with dollars-and-cents menor the kingly orderis worse than suicide for one who desires to go back to Godhead. In other wordsthe transcendentalists do not generally associate with men who are too enamored by the external beauty of God's creation. By advanced knowledge in spiritual realizationthe transcendentalist knows that this beautiful material world is nothing but a shadowy reflection of the realitythe kingdom of God. They are notthereforevery much captivated by royal opulence or anything like that. But in the case of Mahārāja Parīkṣitthe situation was different. Apparently the King was condemned to death by an inexperienced brāhmaṇa boybut factually he was called by the Lord to return to Him. Other transcendentaliststhe great sages and mystics who assembled together because of Mahārāja Parīkṣit's fasting unto deathwere quite anxious to see himfor he was going back to Godhead. Mahārāja Parīkṣit also could understand that the great sages who assembled there were all kind to his forefathersthe Pāṇḍavasbecause of their devotional service to the Lord. He therefore felt grateful to the sages for being present there at the last stage of his lifeand he felt that it was all due to the greatness of his late forefathers or grandfathers. He felt proudthereforethat he happened to be the descendant of such great devotees. Such pride for the devotees of the Lord is certainly not equal to the puffed-up sense of vanity for material prosperity. The first is realitywhereas the other is false and vain."
