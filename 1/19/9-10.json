He is famous as Gādhi-suta because his father was Gādhia powerful king of the province of Kanyākubja (part of Uttara Pradesh). Although he was a kṣatriya by birthhe became a brāhmaṇa in the very same body by the power of his spiritual achievements. He picked a quarrel with Vasiṣṭha Muni when he was a kṣatriya king and performed a great sacrifice in cooperation with Maṭaṅga Muni and thus was able to vanquish the sons of Vasiṣṭha. He became a great yogīand yet he failed to check his senses and thus was obliged to become the father of Śakuntalāthe beauty queen of world history. Oncewhen he was a kṣatriya kinghe visited the hermitage of Vasiṣṭha Muniand he was given a royal reception. Viśvāmitra wanted from Vasiṣṭha a cow named Nandinīand the Muni refused to deliver it. Viśvāmitra stole the cowand thus there was a quarrel between the sage and the King. Viśvāmitra was defeated by the spiritual strength of Vasiṣṭhaand thus the King decided to become a brāhmaṇa. Before becoming a brāhmaṇa he underwent severe austerity on the bank of the Kauśika. He was also one who tried to stop the Kurukṣetra war."
