            "text": "In this verse the King has placed two questions before the learned sages. The first question is what is the duty of everyone in all circumstancesand the second question is what is the specific duty of one who is to die very shortly. Out of the twothe question relating to the dying man is most important because everyone is a dying maneither very shortly or after one hundred years. The duration of life is immaterialbut the duty of a dying man is very important. Mahārāja Parīkṣit placed these two questions before Śukadeva Gosvāmī also on his arrivaland practically the whole of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatambeginning from the Second Canto up to the last Twelfth Cantodeals with these two questions. The conclusion arrived at thereof is that devotional service of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇaas it is confirmed by the Lord Himself in the last phases of the Bhagavad-gītāis the last word in relation to everyone's permanent duty in life. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was already aware of this factbut he wanted the great sages assembled there to unanimously give their verdict on his conviction so that he might be able to go on with his confirmed duty without controversy. He has especially mentioned the word śuddhaor perfectly correct. For transcendental realization or self-realizationmany processes are recommended by various classes of philosophers. Some of them are first-class methodsand some of them are second- or third-class methods. The first-class method demands that one give up all other methods and surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord and thus be saved from all sins and their reactions."
