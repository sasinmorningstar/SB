Śukadeva Gosvāmī was not known as brahmarṣirājarṣi or devarṣinor was he an incarnation like NāradaVyāsa or Paraśurāma. And yet he excelled them in respects paid. This means that the devotee of the Lord is more honored in the world than the Lord Himself. One should therefore never minimize the importance of a devotee like Śukadeva Gosvāmī."
