The demigods are more luxurious than human beingsbut all of them are obedient to the orders of the Supreme Lord. There is no one in the heavenly planets who is an atheist or nonbeliever. Thus any devotee of the Lord on the surface of the earth is always praised by themand in the case of Mahārāja Parīkṣit they were greatly delighted and thus gave tokens of honor by scattering flowers over the earth and by beating celestial drums. A demigod takes pleasure in seeing someone go back to Godhead. He is always pleased with a devotee of the Lordso much so that by his adhidaivic powers he may help the devotees in all respects. And by their actionsthe Lord is pleased with them. There is an invisible chain of complete cooperation between the Lordthe demigods and the devotee of the Lord on earth."
