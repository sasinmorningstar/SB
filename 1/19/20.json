The human life is meant for achieving this end. The Lord has assured us in the Bhagavad-gītā many times that going back to GodheadHis eternal abodeis the highest achievement. Prahlāda Mahārājawhile praying to Lord Nṛsiṁhasaid\"O my LordI am very much afraid of the materialistic way of lifeand I am not the least afraid of Your present ghastly ferocious feature as Nṛsiṁhadeva. This materialistic way of life is something like a grinding stoneand we are being crushed by it. We have fallen into this horrible whirlpool of the tossing waves of lifeand thusmy LordI pray at Your lotus feet to call me back to Your eternal abode as one of Your servitors. This is the summit liberation of this materialistic way of life. I have very bitter experience of the materialistic way of life. In whichever species of life I have taken birthcompelled by the force of my own activitiesI have very painfully experienced two thingsnamely separation from my beloved and meeting with what is not wanted. And to counteract themthe remedies which I undertook were more dangerous than the disease itself. So I drift from one point to another birth after birthand I pray to You therefore to give me a shelter at Your lotus feet.\""

They were never captivated by the glare of the imperial throne they occupiedand they sought always the opportunity of being called by the Lord to associate with Him eternally. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was the worthy grandson of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira gave up the imperial throne to his grandsonand similarly Mahārāja Parīkṣitthe grandson of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhiragave up the imperial throne to his son Janamejaya. That is the way of all the kings in the dynasty because they are all strictly in the line of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Thus the devotees of the Lord are never enchanted by the glare of materialistic lifeand they live impartiallyunattached to the objects of the falseillusory materialistic way of life."
