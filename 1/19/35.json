Generally people are attached to family mattersand the whole economic impetus of human society is moving under the influence of family affection. Such deluded persons have no information that one can render better service to the family by becoming a devotee of the Lord. The Lord gives special protection to the family members and descendants of a devoteeeven though such members are themselves nondevotees! Mahārāja Prahlāda was a great devotee of the Lordbut his fatherHiraṇyakaśipuwas a great atheist and declared enemy of the Lord. But despite all thisHiraṇyakaśipu was awarded salvation due to his being the father of Mahārāja Prahlāda. The Lord is so kind that he gives all protection to the family members of His devoteeand thus the devotee has no need to bother about his family memberseven if one leaves such family members aside to discharge devotional service. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and his brothers were the sons of Kuntīthe paternal aunt of Lord Kṛṣṇaand Mahārāja Parīkṣit admits the patronage of Lord Kṛṣṇa because of his being the only grandson of the great Pāṇḍavas."
