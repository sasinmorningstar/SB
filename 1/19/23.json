You are all as good as supreme knowledge personified, who resides in the planet above the three worlds [Satyaloka]. Consequently you are naturally inclined to do good to others, and but for this you have no interest, either in this life or in the next.\n\n",

The living beingswho are part-and-parcel entities of the Supreme Beinghave all these attributes partiallyup to the full strength of seventy-eight percent. In the material world these attributes (up to seventy-eight percent of the Lord's attributes) are covered by the material energyas the sun is covered by a cloud. The covered strength of the sun is very dimcompared to the original glareand similarly the original color of the living beings with such attributes becomes almost extinct. There are three planetary systemsnamely the lower worldsthe intermediate worlds and the upper worlds. The human beings on earth are situated at the beginning of the intermediate worldsbut living beings like Brahmā and his contemporaries live in the upper worldsof which the topmost is Satyaloka. In Satyaloka the inhabitants are fully cognizant of Vedic wisdomand thus the mystic cloud of material energy is cleared. Therefore they are known as the Vedas personified. Such personsbeing fully aware of knowledge both mundane and transcendentalhave no interest in either the mundane or transcendental worlds. They are practically desireless devotees. In the mundane world they have nothing to achieveand in the transcendental world they are full in themselves. Then why do they come to the mundane world? They descend on different planets as messiahs by the order of the Lord to deliver the fallen souls. On the earth they come down and do good to the people of the world in different circumstances under different climatic influences. They have nothing to do in this world save and except reclaim the fallen souls rotting in material existencedeluded by material energy."
