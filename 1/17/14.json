But when the executive heads are strong enough to curb all sorts of dishonest miscreantsin any part of the statecertainly they cannot flourish. When the miscreants are punished in an exemplary mannerautomatically all good fortune follows. As said beforeit is the prime duty of the king or the executive head to give protection in all respects to the peacefuloffenseless citizens of the state. The devotees of the Lord are by nature peaceful and offenselessand therefore it is the prime duty of the state to arrange to convert everyone to become a devotee of the Lord. Thus automatically there will be peacefuloffenseless citizens. Then the only duty of the king will be to curb the dishonest miscreants. That will bring about peace and harmony all over human society."
