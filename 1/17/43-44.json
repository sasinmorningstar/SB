            "text": "The prolonged sacrificial ceremonies undertaken by the sages of Naimiṣāraṇya were begun shortly after the demise of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. The sacrifice was to continue for one thousand yearsand it is understood that in the beginning some of the contemporaries of Baladevathe elder brother of Lord Kṛṣṇaalso visited the sacrificial place. According to some authoritiesthe present tense is also used to indicate the nearest margin of time from the past. In that sensethe present tense is applied to the reign of Mahārāja Parīkṣit here. For a continuous factalsopresent tense can be used. The principles of Mahārāja Parīkṣit can be still continuedand human society can still be improved if there is determination by the authorities. We can still purge out from the state all the activities of immorality introduced by the personality of Kali if we are determined to take action like Mahārāja Parīkṣit. He allotted some place for Kalibut in fact Kali could not find such places in the world at all because Mahārāja Parīkṣit was strictly vigilant to see that there were no places for gamblingdrinkingprostitution and animal slaughter. Modern administrators want to banish corruption from the statebut fools as they arethey do not know how to do it. They want to issue licenses for gambling houseswine and other intoxicating drug housesbrothelshotel prostitution and cinema housesand falsity in every dealingeven in their ownand they want at the same time to drive out corruption from the state. They want the kingdom of God without God consciousness. How can it be possible to adjust two contradictory matters? If we want to drive out corruption from the statewe must first of all organize society to accept the principles of religionnamely austeritycleanlinessmercy and truthfulnessand to make the condition favorable we must close all places of gamblingdrinkingprostitution and falsity. These are some of the practical lessons from the pages of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam."
