He was smiling because the artificially dressed Kali had disclosed his identity as a lower-class manand he was thinking how ironic it was that although no one was saved from his sharp sword when he desired to killthe poor lower-class Kali was spared by his timely surrender. Mahārāja Parīkṣit's glory and kindness are therefore sung in history. He was a kind and compassionate emperorfully worthy of accepting surrender even from his enemy. Thus the personality of Kali was saved by the will of Providence."
