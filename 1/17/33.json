Such sacrificial ceremonies are prescribed differently in the scriptures for different ages. In other wordssacrifice means to accept the supremacy of the Lord and thereby perform acts by which the Lord may be satisfied in all respects. The atheists do not believe in the existence of Godand they do not perform any sacrifice for the satisfaction of the Lord. Any place or country where the supremacy of the Lord is accepted and thus sacrifice is performed is called brahmāvarta. There are different countries in different parts of the worldand each and every country may have different types of sacrifice to please the Supreme Lordbut the central point in pleasing Him is ascertained in the Bhāgavatamand it is truthfulness. The basic principle of religion is truthfulnessand the ultimate goal of all religions is to satisfy the Lord. In this age of Kalithe greatest common formula of sacrifice is the saṅkīrtana-yajña. That is the opinion of the experts who know how to propagate the process of yajña. Lord Caitanya preached this method of yajñaand it is understood from this verse that the sacrificial method of saṅkīrtana-yajña may be performed anywhere and everywhere in order to drive away the personality of Kali and save human society from falling prey to the influence of the age."
