For a human beingwho has only a maximum one-hundred-year duration of lifea span of life spreading over millions of years is certainly considered to be deathless. For examplefrom the Bhagavad-gītā we learn that on the Brahmaloka planet the duration of one day is calculated to be 4,300,000 x 1,000 solar years. Similarlyin other heavenly planets one day is calculated to be six months of this planetand the inhabitants get a life of ten million of their years. Thereforein all higher planetssince the span of life is far greater than that of the human beingthe denizens are called deathless by imaginationalthough actually no one within the material universe is deathless."

This means that the state executive head must be as strong as Mahārāja Parīkṣit so that he may be determined to punish the strongest offenders. It should be the principle of a state executive head that the offender of the codes of God is always punished."
