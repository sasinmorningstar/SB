            "text": "The Vaiṣṇavitesthe devotees of the Lorddo believeas above explainedthat nothing can take place without the sanction of the Supreme Lord. He is the supreme directorfor He confirms in the Bhagavad-gītā  that Heas all-pervading Paramātmāstays in everyone's heart and keeps vigilance over all actions and witnesses all activities. The argument of the atheist that one cannot be punished for one's misdeeds unless proved before a qualified justice is refuted hereinfor we accept the perpetual witness and constant companion of the living being. A living being may forget all that he might have done in his past or present lifebut one must know that in the same tree of the material bodythe individual soul and the Supreme Soul as Paramātmā are sitting like two birds. One of themthe living beingis enjoying the fruits of the treewhereas the Supreme Being is there to witness the activities. Therefore the Paramātmā featurethe Supreme Soulis actually the witness of all activities of the living beingand only by His direction can the living being remember or forget what he might have done in the past. He isthereforeboth the all-pervading impersonal Brahman and the localized Paramātmā in everyone's heart. He is the knower of all pastpresent and futureand nothing can be concealed from Him. The devotees know this truthand therefore they discharge their duties sincerelywithout being overly anxious for rewards. Besides thatone cannot estimate the Lord's reactionseither by speculation or by scholarship. Why does He put some into difficulty and not others? He is the supreme knower of the Vedic knowledgeand thus He is the factual Vedāntist. At the same time He is the compiler of the Vedānta. No one is independent of Himand everyone is engaged in His service in different ways. In the conditioned statesuch services are rendered by the living being under force of the material naturewhereas in the liberated state the living being is helped by the spiritual nature in the voluntary loving service of the Lord. There is no incongruity or inebriety in His actions. All are on the path of Absolute Truth. Bhīṣmadeva correctly estimated the inconceivable actions of the Lord. The conclusion isthereforethat the sufferings of the representative of religion and the representative of the earthas present before Mahārāja Parīkṣitwere planned to prove that Mahārāja Parīkṣit was the ideal executive head because he knew well how to give protection to the cows (the earth) and the brāhmaṇas (religious principles)the two pillars of spiritual advancement. Everyone is under the full control of the Lord. He is quite correct in His action when He desires something to be done by someoneirrespective of the consideration of the particular case. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was thus put to test for his greatness. Now let us see how he solves it by his sagacious mind."
