Such rulers illegally gratify themselves at the cost of all comforts of the citizensand thus the chaste mother earth cries to see the pitiable condition of her sonsboth men and animals. That is the future of the world in the age of Kaliwhen irreligiosity prevails most prominently. And in the absence of a suitable king to curb irreligious tendencieseducating the people systematically in the teaching of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam will clear up the hazy atmosphere of corruptionbriberyblackmailetc."
