Knowing the ultimate doerone should not pose himself as ignorant of the actual performer. To answer this doubtthe reply is that the Lord is also not directly responsiblefor everything is done by His deputed māyā-śaktior material energy. The material energy is always provoking doubts about the supreme authority of the Lord. The personality of religion knew perfectly well that nothing can take place without the sanction of the Supreme Lordand still he was put into doubts by the deluding energyand thus he refrained from mentioning the supreme cause. This doubtfulness was due to the contamination of both Kali and the material energy. The whole atmosphere of the age of Kali is magnified by the deluding energyand the proportion of measurement is inexplicable."
