            "text": "The principles of religion do not stand on some dogmas or man-made formulasbut they stand on four primary regulative observancesnamely austeritycleanlinessmercy and truthfulness. The mass of people must be taught to practice these principles from childhood. Austerity means to accept voluntarily things which may not be very comfortable for the body but are conducive for spiritual realizationfor examplefasting. Fasting twice or four times a month is a sort of austerity which may be voluntarily accepted for spiritual realization onlyand not for any other purposespolitical or otherwise. Fastings which are meant not for self-realization but for some other purposes are condemned in the Bhagavad-gītā . Similarlycleanliness is necessary both for the mind and for the body. Simply bodily cleanliness may help to some extentbut cleanliness of the mind is necessaryand it is effected by glorifying the Supreme Lord. No one can cleanse the accumulated mental dust without glorifying the Supreme Lord. A godless civilization cannot cleanse the mind because it has no idea of Godand for this simple reason people under such a civilization cannot have good qualificationshowever they may be materially equipped. We have to see things by their resultant action. The resultant action of human civilization in the age of Kali is dissatisfactionso everyone is anxious to get peace of mind. This peace of mind was complete in the Satya age because of the existence of the above-mentioned attributes of the human beings. Gradually these attributes have diminished in the Tretā-yuga to three fourthsin the Dvāpara to halfand in this age of Kali to one fourthwhich is also gradually diminishing on account of prevailing untruthfulness. By prideeither artificial or realthe resultant action of austerity is spoiled; by too much affection for female associationcleanliness is spoiled; by too much addiction to intoxicationmercy is spoiled; and by too much lying propagandatruthfulness is spoiled. The revival of bhāgavata-dharma can save human civilization from falling prey to evils of all description."
