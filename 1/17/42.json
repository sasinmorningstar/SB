In the presence of KaliDharma (in the shape of a bull)and the earth (in the shape of a cow)he could actually estimate the general condition of his kingdomand therefore he at once took proper steps to reestablish the legs of the bullnamely austeritycleanliness and mercy. And for the general benefit of the people of the worldhe saw that the gold stock might be employed for stabilization. Gold is certainly a generator of falsityintoxicationprostitutionenmity and violencebut under the guidance of a proper king or public leaderor a brāhmaṇa or sannyāsīthe same gold can be properly utilized to reestablish the lost legs of the bullthe personality of religion."

As we have suggested beforeone's accumulated wealth may be divided into three parts for distributionnamely fifty percent for the service of the Lordtwenty-five percent for the family members and twenty-five percent for personal necessities. Spending fifty percent for the service of the Lord or for propagation of spiritual knowledge in society by way of the saṅkīrtana-yajña is the maximum display of human mercy. People of the world are generally in darkness regarding spiritual knowledgeespecially in regard to the devotional service of the Lordand therefore to propagate the systematic transcendental knowledge of devotional service is the greatest mercy that one can show in this world. When everyone is taught to sacrifice fifty percent of his accumulated gold for the Lord's servicecertainly austeritycleanliness and mercy automatically ensueand thus the lost three legs of the personality of religion are automatically established. When there is sufficient austeritycleanlinessmercy and truthfulnessnaturally mother earth is completely satisfiedand there is very little chance for Kali to infiltrate the structure of human society."
