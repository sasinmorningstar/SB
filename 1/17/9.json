            "text": "Protection of bulls and cows and all other animals can be possible only when there is a state ruled by an executive head like Mahārāja Parīkṣit. Mahārāja Parīkṣit addresses the cow as motherfor he is a culturedtwice-bornkṣatriya king. Surabhi is the name of the cows which exist in the spiritual planets and are especially reared by Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. As men are made after the form and features of the Supreme Lordso also the cows are made after the form and features of the surabhi cows in the spiritual kingdom. In the material world the human society gives all protection to the human beingbut there is no law to protect the descendants of Surabhiwho can give all protection to men by supplying the miracle foodmilk. But Mahārāja Parīkṣit and the Pāṇḍavas were fully conscious of the importance of the cow and bulland they were prepared to punish the cow-killer with all chastisementincluding death. There has sometimes been agitation for the protection of the cowbut for want of pious executive heads and suitable lawsthe cow and the bull are not given protection. The human society should recognize the importance of the cow and the bull and thus give all protection to these important animalsfollowing in the footsteps of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. For protecting the cows and brahminical culturethe Lordwho is very kind to the cow and the brāhmaṇas (go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya)will be pleased with us and will bestow upon us real peace."
