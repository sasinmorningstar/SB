There is no need to turn from Hindu to Mohammedan to Christian or some other faith and thus become a renegade and not follow the principles of religion. The Bhāgavatam religion urges following the principles of religion. The principles of religion are not the dogmas or regulative principles of a certain faith. Such regulative principles may be different in terms of the time and place concerned. One has to see whether the aims of religion have been achieved. Sticking to the dogmas and formulas without attaining the real principles is not good. A secular state may be impartial to any particular type of faithbut the state cannot be indifferent to the principles of religion as above-mentioned. But in the age of Kalithe executive heads of state will be indifferent to such religious principlesand therefore under their patronage the opponents of religious principlessuch as greedfalsehoodcheating and pilferywill naturally followand so there will be no meaning to propaganda crying to stop corruption in the state."
