The Pāṇḍavas were entrusted representatives of the Personality of GodheadLord Kṛṣṇawho practically brought into being the Battle of Kurukṣetrabut not for any personal interest. He wanted an ideal king like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and his descendants like Mahārāja Parīkṣit to rule the worldand therefore a responsible king like Mahārāja Parīkṣit could not allow the friend of irreligiosity to flourish in his kingdom at the cost of the good fame of the Pāṇḍavas. That is the way of wiping out corruption in the stateand not otherwise. The friends of irreligiosity should be banished from the stateand that will save the state from corruption."
