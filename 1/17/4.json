Then only will it be possible to counteract the degraded age. And in the absence of such strong executive headsthere is always disruption of tranquillity. The elected show-bottle executive headas representative of a degraded publiccannot be equal with a strong king like Mahārāja Parīkṣit. The dress or style of royal order does not count. It is one's actions which are counted."
