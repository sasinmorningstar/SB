Great asuras like RāvaṇaHiraṇyakaśipuKaṁsaand others who were very powerful living entities were all killed by the Personality of Godhead. And the almighty Vāsudeva has empowered His name with the powers of His personal Self. Everything is related to Himand everything has its identity in Him. It is stated herein that the name of Kṛṣṇa is feared even by fear personified. This indicates that the name of Kṛṣṇa is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. Thereforethe name of Kṛṣṇa is as powerful as Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. There is no difference at all. Anyonethereforecan take advantage of the holy names of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa even in the midst of greatest dangers. The transcendental name of Kṛṣṇaeven though uttered unconsciously or by force of circumstancescan help one obtain freedom from the hurdle of birth and death."
