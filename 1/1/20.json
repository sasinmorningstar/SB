            "text": "The doctrines of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism are never applicable to Śrī Kṛṣṇaor the Personality of Godhead. The theory that a man becomes God by dint of penance and austerities is very much rampant nowadaysespecially in India. Since Lord RāmaLord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu were detected by the sages and saints to be the Personality of Godhead as indicated in revealed scripturesmany unscrupulous men have created their own incarnations. This process of concocting an incarnation of God has become an ordinary businessespecially in Bengal. Any popular personality with a few traits of mystic powers will display some feat of jugglery and easily become an incarnation of Godhead by popular vote. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was not that type of incarnation. He was actually the Personality of Godhead from the very beginning of His appearance. He appeared before His so-called mother as four-armed Viṣṇu. Thenat the request of the motherHe became like a human child and at once left her for another devotee at Gokulawhere He was accepted as the son of Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodā Mātā. SimilarlyŚrī Baladevathe counterpart of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇawas also considered a human child born of another wife of Śrī Vasudeva. In Bhagavad-gītāthe Lord says that His birth and deeds are transcendental and that anyone who is so fortunate as to know the transcendental nature of His birth and deeds will at once become liberated and eligible to return to the kingdom of God. So knowledge of the transcendental nature of the birth and deeds of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is sufficient for liberation. In the Bhāgavatamthe transcendental nature of the Lord is described in nine cantosand in the Tenth Canto His specific pastimes are taken up. All this becomes known as one's reading of this literature progresses. It is important to note herehoweverthat the Lord exhibited His divinity even from the lap of His motherthat His deeds are all superhuman (He lifted Govardhana Hill at the age of seven)and that all these acts definitely prove Him to be actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yetdue to His mystic coveringHe was always accepted as an ordinary human child by His so-called father and mother and other relatives. Whenever some herculean task was performed by Himthe father and mother took it otherwise. And they remained satisfied with unflinching filial love for their son. As suchthe sages of Naimiṣāraṇya describe Him as apparently resembling a human beingbut actually He is the supreme almighty Personality of Godhead."
