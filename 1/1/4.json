The hub of this great circle was fixed at a particular place known as Naimiṣāraṇya. Similarlythere is another reference to the forest of Naimiṣāraṇya in the Varāha Purāṇawhere it is stated that by performance of sacrifice at this placethe strength of demoniac people is curtailed. Thus brāhmaṇas prefer Naimiṣāraṇya for such sacrificial performances."

The devotees are always attached to the service of the Lordwhereas fallen souls are attached to the pleasures of material existence. In Bhagavad-gītāit is said that anything performed in the material world for any reason other than for the pleasure of Lord Viṣṇu causes further bondage for the performer. It is enjoined therefore that all acts must be performed sacrificially for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu and His devotees. This will bring everyone peace and prosperity."

Forgetful men do not know the right path for peace and prosperity. Howeverthe sages know it welland therefore for the good of all men they are always anxious to perform acts which may bring about peace in the world. They are sincere friends to all living entitiesand at the risk of great personal inconvenience they are always engaged in the service of the Lord for the good of all people. Lord Viṣṇu is just like a great treeand all othersincluding the demigodsmenSiddhasCāraṇasVidyādharas and other living entitiesare like branchestwigs and leaves of that tree. By pouring water on the root of the treeall the parts of the tree are automatically nourished. Only those branches and leaves which are detached cannot be so satisfied. Detached branches and leaves dry up gradually despite all watering attempts. Similarlyhuman societywhen it is detached from the Personality of Godhead like detached branches and leavesis not capable of being wateredand one attempting to do so is simply wasting his energy and resources."
