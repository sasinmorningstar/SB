His creations both material and spiritual are all wonderful and contain all variegatedness. They are described nicely by such liberated souls as Śrīla NāradaVyāsaVālmīkiDevalaAsitaMadhvaŚrī CaitanyaRāmānujaViṣṇu SvāmīNimbārkaŚrīdharaViśvanāthaBaladevaBhaktivinodaSiddhānta Sarasvatī and many other learned and self-realized souls. These creationsboth material and spiritualare full of opulencebeauty and knowledgebut the spiritual realm is more magnificent due to its being full of knowledgebliss and eternity. The material creations are manifested for some time as perverted shadows of the spiritual kingdom and can be likened to cinemas. They attract people of less intelligent caliber who are attracted by false things. Such foolish men have no information of the realityand they take it for granted that the false material manifestation is the all in all. But more intelligent men guided by sages like Vyāsa and Nārada know that the eternal kingdom of God is more delightfullargerand eternally full of bliss and knowledge. Those who are not conversant with the activities of the Lord and His transcendental realm are sometimes favored by the Lord in His adventures as incarnations wherein He displays the eternal bliss of His association in the transcendental realm. By such activities He attracts the conditioned souls of the material world. Some of these conditioned souls are engaged in the false enjoyment of material senses and others in simply negating their real life in the spiritual world. These less intelligent persons are known as karmīsor fruitive workersand jñānīsor dry mental speculators. But above these two classes of men is the transcendentalist known as sātvataor the devoteewho is busy neither with rampant material activity nor with material speculation. He is engaged in the positive service of the Lordand thereby he derives the highest spiritual benefit unknown to the karmīs and jñānīs."
