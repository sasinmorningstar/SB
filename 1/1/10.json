When the sages of Naimiṣāraṇya analyzed the state of affairs of the people in this age of Kalithey foresaw that men would live short lives. In Kali-yugathe duration of life is shortened not so much because of insufficient food but because of irregular habits. By keeping regular habits and eating simple foodany man can maintain his health. Overeatingover-sense gratificationoverdependence on another's mercyand artificial standards of living sap the very vitality of human energy. Therefore the duration of life is shortened."

That is to sayman should come to know what he iswhat the world isand what the supreme truth is. Human life is a means by which the living entity can end all the miseries of the hard struggle for life in material existence and by which he can return to Godheadhis eternal home. Butdue to a bad system of educationmen have no desire for self-realization. Even if they come to know about itthey unfortunately become victims of misguided teachers."

Their minds are always disturbed and full of anxieties due to so many different engagements. In this agemany unscrupulous men manufacture their own religious faiths which are not based on any revealed scripturesand very often people who are addicted to sense gratification are attracted by such institutions. Consequentlyin the name of religion so many sinful acts are being carried on that the people in general have neither peace of mind nor health of body. The student (brahmacārī) communities are no longer being maintainedand householders do not observe the rules and regulations of the gṛhastha-āśrama. Consequentlythe so-called vānaprasthas and sannyāsīs who come out of such gṛhastha-āśramas are easily deviated from the rigid path. In the Kali-yuga the whole atmosphere is surcharged with faithlessness. Men are no longer interested in spiritual values. Material sense gratification is now the standard of civilization. For the maintenance of such material civilizationsman has formed complex nations and communitiesand there is a constant strain of hot and cold wars between these different groups. It has become very difficultthereforeto raise the spiritual standard due to the present distorted values of human society. The sages of Naimiṣāraṇya are anxious to disentangle all fallen soulsand here they are seeking the remedy from Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī."
