But one can be sanctified at once by the mercy of a pure devotee of the Lord. In Bhagavad-gītā it is said that any personregardless of birth as śūdrawomanor merchantcan take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and by so doing can return to Godhead. To take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord means to take shelter of the pure devotees. The pure devotees whose only business is serving are honored by the names Prabhupāda and Viṣṇupādawhich indicate such devotees to be representatives of the lotus feet of the Lord. Anyonethereforewho takes shelter of the lotus feet of a pure devotee by accepting the pure devotee as his spiritual master can be at once purified. Such devotees of the Lord are honored equally with the Lord because they are engaged in the most confidential service of the Lordfor they deliver out of the material world the fallen souls whom the Lord wants to return homeback to Godhead. Such pure devotees are better known as vicelords according to revealed scriptures. The sincere disciple of the pure devotee considers the spiritual master equal to the Lordbut always considers himself to be a humble servant of the servant of the Lord . This is the pure devotional path."
