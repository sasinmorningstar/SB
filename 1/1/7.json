It is called natural because Vyāsadeva is author of both the Vedānta-sūtras and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamor the essence of all Vedic literatures. Besides Vyāsadevathere are other sages who are the authors of six different philosophical systemsnamely GautamaKaṇādaKapilaPatañjaliJaimini and Aṣṭāvakra. Theism is explained completely in the Vedānta-sūtrawhereas in other systems of philosophical speculationspractically no mention is given to the ultimate cause of all causes. One can sit on the vyāsāsana only after being conversant in all systems of philosophy so that one can present fully the theistic views of the Bhāgavatam in defiance of all other systems. Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī was the proper teacherand therefore the sages at Naimiṣāraṇya elevated him to the vyāsāsana. Śrīla Vyāsadeva is designated herein as the Personality of Godhead because he is the authorized empowered incarnation."
