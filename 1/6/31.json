            "text": "As stated in the Bhagavad-gītāthere are three divisions of the material spheresnamely the ūrdhva-loka (topmost planets)madhya-loka (midway planets) and adho-loka (downward planets). Beyond the ūrdhva-loka planetsthat is to say above the Brahmalokaare the material coverings of the universesand above that is the spiritual skywhich is unlimited in expansioncontaining unlimited self-illuminated Vaikuṇṭha planets inhabited by God Himself along with His associateswho are all eternally liberated living entities. Śrī Nārada Muni could enter all these planets in both the material and spiritual spheres without restrictionas much as the almighty Lord is free to move personally in any part of His creation. In the material world the living beings are influenced by the three material modes of naturenamely goodnesspassion and ignorance. But Śrī Nārada Muni is transcendental to all these material modesand thus he can travel everywhere unrestricted. He is a liberated spaceman. The causeless mercy of Lord Viṣṇu is unparalleledand such mercy is perceived by the devotees only by the grace of the Lord. Thereforethe devotees never fall downbut the materialistsi.e.the fruitive workers and the speculative philosophersdo fall downbeing forced by their respective modes of nature. The ṛṣisas above mentionedcannot enter into the transcendental world like Nārada. This fact is disclosed in the Narasiṁha Purāṇa. Ṛṣis like Marīci are authorities in fruitive workand ṛṣis like Sanaka and Sanātana are authorities in philosophical speculations. But Śrī Nārada Muni is the prime authority for transcendental devotional service of the Lord. All the great authorities in the devotional service of the Lord follow in the footsteps of Nārada Muni in the order of the Nārada-bhakti-sūtraand therefore all the devotees of the Lord are unhesitatingly qualified to enter into the kingdom of GodVaikuṇṭha."
