But when he thinksfeels and wills materiallyhe becomes entangledand conversely when he thinksfeels and wills for the service of the Lordhe becomes gradually freed from all entanglement. The more a person is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lordthe more he acquires a hankering for it. That is the transcendental nature of godly service. Material service has satiationwhereas spiritual service of the Lord has neither satiation nor end. One can go on increasing his hankerings for the loving transcendental service of the Lordand yet he will not find satiation or end. By intense service of the Lordone can experience the presence of the Lord transcendentally. Therefore seeing the Lord means being engaged in His service because His service and His person are identical. The sincere devotee should go on with sincere service of the Lord. The Lord will give proper direction as to how and where it has to be done. There was no material desire in Nāradaand yet just to increase his intense desire for the Lordhe was so advised."
