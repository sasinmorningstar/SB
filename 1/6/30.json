So for this period Brahmājī rests in yoga-nidrā within the body of the Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇuthe generator of Brahmā. Thus after the sleeping period of Brahmāwhen there is again creation by the will of the Lord through the agency of Brahmāall the great ṛṣis again appear from different parts of the transcendental bodyand Nārada also appears. This means that Nārada appears in the same transcendental bodyjust as a man awakes from sleep in the same body. Śrī Nārada is eternally free to move in all parts of the transcendental and material creations of the Almighty. He appears and disappears in his own transcendental bodywhich is without distinction of body and soulunlike conditioned beings."
