This transcendental instrument is identical with Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Nārada because all of them are of the same transcendental category. Sound vibrated by the instrument cannot be materialand therefore the glories and pastimes which are broadcast by the instrument of Nārada are also transcendentalwithout a tinge of material inebriety. The seven singing metersnamely ṣa (ṣaḍja)ṛ (ṛṣabha)gā (gāndhāra)ma (madhyama)pa (pañcama)dha (dhaivata) and ni (niṣāda)are also transcendental and specifically meant for transcendental songs. As a pure devotee of the LordŚrī Nāradadeva is always fulfilling his obligation to the Lord for His gift of the instrumentand thus he is always engaged in singing His transcendental glories and is therefore infallible in his exalted position. Following in the footsteps of Śrīla Nārada Munia self-realized soul in the material world should also properly use the sound metersnamely ṣaṛgāmāetc.in the service of the Lord by constantly singing the glories of the Lordas confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā."
