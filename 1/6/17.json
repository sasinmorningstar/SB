We can just have a glimpse of such ecstasy in the words of Śrī Nārada Muni. Each and every part of the body or senses has its particular function. After seeing the Lordall the senses become fully awakened to render service unto the Lord because in the liberated state the senses are fully efficient in serving the Lord. As suchin that transcendental ecstasy it so happened that the senses became separately enlivened to serve the Lord. This being soNārada Muni lost himself in seeing both himself and the Lord simultaneously."
