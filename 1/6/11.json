After many hundreds of millions of yearsone creation is started by the law of natureand the history of the universe repeats itself practically in the same way. The mundane wranglers waste time with archaeological excavations without searching into the vital necessities of life. After getting an impetus in spiritual lifeŚrī Nārada Munieven though a mere childdid not waste time for a single moment with economic developmentalthough he passed towns and villagesmines and industries. He continually went on to progressive spiritual emancipation. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is the repetition of history which happened some hundreds of millions of years ago. As it is said hereinonly the most important factors of history are picked up to be recorded in this transcendental literature."
