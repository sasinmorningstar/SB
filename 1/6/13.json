            "text": "It is the duty of a mendicant (parivrājakācārya) to experience all varieties of God's creation by traveling alone through all forestshillstownsvillagesetc.to gain faith in God and strength of mind as well as to enlighten the inhabitants with the message of God. A sannyāsī is duty-bound to take all these risks without fearand the most typical sannyāsī of the present age is Lord Caitanyawho traveled in the same manner through the central Indian junglesenlightening even the tigersbearssnakesdeerelephants and many other jungle animals. In this age of Kalisannyāsa is forbidden for ordinary men. One who changes his dress to make propaganda is a different man from the original ideal sannyāsī. One shouldhowevertake the vow to stop social intercourse completely and devote life exclusively to the service of the Lord. The change of dress is only a formality. Lord Caitanya did not accept the name of a sannyāsīand in this age of Kali the so-called sannyāsīs should not change their former namesfollowing in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya. In this agedevotional service of hearing and repeating the holy glories of the Lord is strongly recommendedand one who takes the vow of renunciation of family life need not imitate the parivrājakācārya like Nārada or Lord Caitanyabut may sit down at some holy place and devote his whole time and energy to hear and repeatedly chant the holy scriptures left by the great ācāryas like the six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana."
