The brāhmaṇas are meant to administer some fruitive sacrifices mentioned in the Vedasbut the parivrājakācāryasor learned preachersare meant to disseminate transcendental knowledge to one and all. As suchthe parivrājakācāryas are not always expert in pronouncing the Vedic mantraswhich are practiced systematically by accent and meter by the brāhmaṇas who are meant for administering Vedic rites. Yet it should not be considered that the brāhmaṇas are more important than the itinerant preachers. They are one and different simultaneously because they are meant for the same endin different ways."

            "text": "There is no difference also between the Vedic mantras and what is explained in the Purāṇas and Itihāsa. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmīit is mentioned in the Mādhyandina-śruti that all the Vedasnamely the SāmaAtharvaṚgYajurPurāṇasItihāsasUpaniṣadsetc.are emanations from the breathing of the Supreme Being. The only difference is that the Vedic mantras are mostly begun with praṇava oṁkāraand it requires some training to practice the metric pronunciation of the Vedic mantras. But that does not mean that Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is of less importance than the Vedic mantras. On the contraryit is the ripened fruit of all the Vedasas stated before. Besides thatthe most perfectly liberated soulŚrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmīis absorbed in the studies of the Bhāgavatamalthough he is already self-realized. Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī is following his footstepsand therefore his position is not the least less important because he was not expert in chanting Vedic mantras with metric pronunciationwhich depends more on practice than actual realization. Realization is more important than parrotlike chanting."
