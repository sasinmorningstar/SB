But to make them more easily performablethe Veda was divided into four divisions of sacrificejust to purify the occupational service of the four orders. Above the four Vedasnamely ṚgYajurSāmaand Atharvathere are the Purāṇasthe MahābhārataSaṁhitāsetc.which are known as the fifth Veda. Śrī Vyāsadeva and his many disciples were all historical personalitiesand they were very kind and sympathetic toward the fallen souls of this age of Kali. As suchthe Purāṇas and Mahābhārata were made from related historical facts which explained the teaching of the four Vedas. There is no point in doubting the authority of the Purāṇas and Mahābhārata as parts and parcels of the Vedas. In the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (7.1.4)the Purāṇas and Mahābhāratagenerally known as historiesare mentioned as the fifth Veda. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmīthat is the way of ascertaining the respective values of the revealed scriptures."
