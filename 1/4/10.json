He inherited it from his grandfathers Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and brothers. Besides thathe was doing well in the administration and was worthy of the good names of his forefathers. Consequently there was nothing undesirable in his opulence and administration. Then why should he give up all these favorable circumstances and sit down on the bank of the Gangesfasting till death? This is astonishingand therefore all were eager to know the cause."
