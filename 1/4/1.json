            "text": "In a meeting of learned menwhen there are congratulations or addresses for the speakerthe qualifications of the congratulator should be as follows. He must be the leader of the house and an elderly man. He must be vastly learned also. Śrī Śaunaka Ṛṣi had all these qualificationsand thus he stood up to congratulate Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī when he expressed his desire to present Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam exactly as he heard it from Śukadeva Gosvāmī and also realized it personally. Personal realization does not mean that one shouldout of vanityattempt to show one's own learning by trying to surpass the previous ācārya. He must have full confidence in the previous ācāryaand at the same time he must realize the subject matter so nicely that he can present the matter for the particular circumstances in a suitable manner. The original purpose of the text must be maintained. No obscure meaning should be screwed out of ityet it should be presented in an interesting manner for the understanding of the audience. This is called realization. The leader of the assemblyŚaunakacould estimate the value of the speakerŚrī Sūta Gosvāmīsimply by his uttering yathādhītam and yathā-matiand therefore he was very glad to congratulate him in ecstasy. No learned man should be willing to hear a person who does not represent the original ācārya. So the speaker and the audience were bona fide in this meeting where Bhāgavatam was being recited for the second time. That should be the standard of recitation of Bhāgavatamso that the real purpose can be served without difficulty. Unless this situation is createdBhāgavatam recitation for extraneous purposes is useless labor both for the speaker and for the audience."
