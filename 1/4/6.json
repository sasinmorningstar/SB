Gosvāmī Śukadevaafter leaving his paternal homewas roaming like a madmanand therefore it was very difficult for the citizens to recognize him in his exalted position. A sage is notthereforerecognized by sightbut by hearing. One should approach a sādhu or great sage not to see but to hear him. If one is not prepared to hear the words of a sādhuthere is no profit. Śukadeva Gosvāmī was a sādhu who could speak on the transcendental activities of the Lord. He did not satisfy the whims of ordinary citizens. He was recognized when he spoke on the subject of Bhāgavatamand he never attempted jugglery like a magician. Outwardly he appeared to be a retardeddumb madmanbut in fact he was the most elevated transcendental personality."
