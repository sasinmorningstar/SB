There was no difficulty in collecting the state taxes because he was so powerful and chivalrous that even his enemies would come to him and bow down at his feet and surrender all wealth for their own benefit. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was a pious king. He conquered his enemiesand therefore the kingdom was full of prosperity. There was enough milkgrains and metalsand all the rivers and mountains were full of potency. So materially everything was satisfactory. Thereforethere was no question of untimely giving up his kingdom and life. The sages were eager to hear about all this."
