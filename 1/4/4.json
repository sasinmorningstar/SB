            "text": "Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī was a liberated souland thus he remained always alert not to be trapped by the illusory energy. In the Bhagavad-gītā this alertness is very lucidly explained. The liberated soul and the conditioned soul have different engagements. The liberated soul is always engaged in the progressive path of spiritual attainmentwhich is something like a dream for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul cannot imagine the actual engagements of the liberated soul. While the conditioned soul thus dreams about spiritual engagementsthe liberated soul is awake. Similarlythe engagement of a conditioned soul appears to be a dream for the liberated soul. A conditioned soul and a liberated soul may apparently be on the same platformbut factually they are differently engagedand their attention is always alerteither in sense enjoyment or in self-realization. The conditioned soul is absorbed in matterwhereas the liberated soul is completely indifferent to matter. This indifference is explained as follows."
