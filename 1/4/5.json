    "translation": "\nWhile Śrī Vyāsadeva was following his son, beautiful young damsels who were bathing naked covered their bodies with cloth, although Śrī Vyāsadeva himself was not naked. But they had not done so when his son had passed. The sage inquired about this, and the young ladies replied that his son was purified and when looking at them made no distinction between male and female. But the sage made such distinctions.\n\n",

            "text": "In the Bhagavad-gītā  it is said that a learned sage looks equally on a learned and gentle brāhmaṇaa caṇḍāla (dog-eater)a dog or a cow due to his spiritual vision. Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī attained that stage. Thus he did not see a male or female; he saw all living entities in different dress. The ladies who were bathing could understand the mind of a man simply by studying his demeanorjust as by looking at a child one can understand how innocent he is. Śukadeva Gosvāmī was a young boy sixteen years oldand therefore all the parts of his body were developed. He was naked alsoand so were the ladies. But because Śukadeva Gosvāmī was transcendental to sex relationshe appeared very innocent. The ladiesby their special qualificationscould sense this at onceand therefore they were not very concerned about him. But when his father passedthe ladies quickly dressed. The ladies were exactly like his children or grandchildrenyet they reacted to the presence of Vyāsadeva according to the social custom because Śrīla Vyāsadeva played the part of a householder. A householder has to distinguish between a male and femaleotherwise he cannot be a householder. One shouldthereforeattempt to know the distinction between body and soul without any attachment for male and female. As long as such distinction is thereone should not try to become a sannyāsī like Śukadeva Gosvāmī. At least theoretically one must be convinced that a living entity is neither male nor female. The outward dress is made of matter by material nature to attract the opposite sex and thus keep one entangled in material existence. A liberated soul is above this perverted distinction. He does not distinguish between one living being and another. For him they are all one and the same spirit. The perfection of this spiritual vision is the liberated stageand Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī attained that stage. Śrīla Vyāsadeva was also in the transcendental stagebut because he was in the householder's lifehe did not pretend to be a liberated soulas a matter of custom."
