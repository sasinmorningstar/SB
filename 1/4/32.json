The monist is not counted amongst the paramahaṁsas (the most perfect of the renounced order of life). Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is full of narrations of the transcendental activities of the Personality of Godhead. Although Vyāsadeva was an empowered divinityhe still felt dissatisfaction because in none of his works were the transcendental activities of the Lord properly explained. The inspiration was infused by Śrī Kṛṣṇa directly in the heart of Vyāsadevaand thus he felt the vacuum as explained above. It is definitely expressed herewith that without the transcendental loving service of the Lordeverything is void; but in the transcendental service of the Lordeverything is tangible without any separate attempt at fruitive work or empiric philosophical speculation."
