The King knew well that brāhmaṇassageschildrenwomen and old men are always beyond the jurisdiction of punishment. Similarlythe kingeven though he commits a great mistakeis never to be considered a wrongdoer. But in this caseMahārāja Parīkṣit became angry and envious at the sage due to his thirst and hungerby the will of the Lord. The King was right to punish his subject for coldly receiving him or neglecting himbut because the culprit was a sage and a brāhmaṇait was unprecedented. As the Lord is never envious of anyoneso also the Lord's devotee is never envious of anyone. The only justification for Mahārāja Parīkṣit's behavior is that it was ordained by the Lord."
