            "text": "The conception of many gods in the Vedic literatures by the ignorant is completely wrong. The Lord is one without a secondbut He expands Himself in many waysand this is confirmed in the Vedas. Such expansions of the Lord are limitlessbut some of them are the living entities. The living entities are not as powerful as the Lord's plenary expansionsand therefore there are two different types of expansions. Lord Brahmā is generally one of the living entitiesand Lord Śiva is the via medium between the Lord and the living entities. In other wordseven demigods like Lord Brahmā and Lord Śivawho are the chief amongst all demigodsare never equal to or greater than Lord Viṣṇuthe Supreme Personality of Godhead. The goddess of fortuneLakṣmīand all-powerful demigods like Brahmā and Śiva are engaged in the worship of Viṣṇu or Lord Kṛṣṇa; therefore who can be more powerful than Mukunda (Lord Kṛṣṇa) to be factually called the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The goddess of fortuneLakṣmījīLord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are not independently powerful; they are powerful as expansions of the Supreme Lordand all of them are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lordand so also are the living entities. There are four sects of worshipful devotees of the Lordand the chief amongst them are the Brahma-sampradāyaRudra-sampradāya and Śrī-sampradāyadescending directly from Lord BrahmāLord Śiva and the goddess of fortuneLakṣmīrespectively. Besides the above-mentioned three sampradāyasthere is the Kumāra-sampradāyadescending from Sanat-kumāra. All of the four original sampradāyas are still scrupulously engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord up to dateand they all declare that Lord KṛṣṇaMukundais the Supreme Personality of Godheadand no other personality is equal to Him or greater than Him."
