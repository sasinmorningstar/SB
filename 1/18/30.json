By the will of the Lordthe Kingwhile going awayfound a dead snake in front of himand he thought that the sagewho had coldly received himthus might be coldly rewarded by being offered a garland of a dead snake. In the ordinary course of dealingthis was not very unnaturalbut in the case of Mahārāja Parīkṣit's dealing with a brāhmaṇa sagethis was certainly unprecedented. It so happened by the will of the Lord."
