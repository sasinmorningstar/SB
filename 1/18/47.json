Ṛṣi Śamīka could foresee that his son had committed a great sin by cursing Mahārāja Parīkṣitwho deserved to be protected by the brāhmaṇasfor he was a pious ruler and completely free from all sins because of his being a first-class devotee of the Lord. When an offense is done unto the devotee of the Lordit is very difficult to overcome the reaction. The brāhmaṇasbeing at the head of the social ordersare meant to give protection to their subordinates and not to curse them. There are occasions when a brāhmaṇa may furiously curse a subordinate kṣatriya or vaiśyaetc.but in the case of Mahārāja Parīkṣit there were no groundsas already explained. The foolish boy had done it out of sheer vanity in being a brāhmaṇa's sonand thus he became liable to be punished by the law of God. The Lord never forgives a person who condemns His pure devotee. Thereforeby cursing a king the foolish Śṛṅgi had committed not only a sin but also the greatest offense. Therefore the ṛṣi could foresee that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead could save his boy from his sinful act. He therefore directly prayed for pardon from the Supreme Lordwho alone can undo a thing which is impossible to change. The appeal was made in the name of a foolish boy who had developed no intelligence at all."

            "text": "A question may be raised herein that since it was the desire of the Lord that Parīkṣit Mahārāja be put into that awkward position so that he might be delivered from material existencethen why was a brāhmaṇa's son made responsible for this offensive act? The answer is that the offensive act was performed by a child only so that he could be excused very easilyand thus the prayer of the father was accepted. But if the question is raised why the brāhmaṇa community as a whole was made responsible for allowing Kali into the world affairsthe answer is given in the Varāha Purāṇa that the demons who acted inimically toward the Personality of Godhead but were not killed by the Lord were allowed to take birth in the families of brāhmaṇas to take advantage of the age of Kali. The all-merciful Lord gave them a chance to have their births in the families of pious brāhmaṇas so that they could progress toward salvation. But the demonsinstead of utilizing the good opportunitymisused the brahminical culture due to being puffed up by vanity in becoming brāhmaṇas. The typical example is the son of Śamīka Ṛṣiand all the foolish sons of brāhmaṇas are warned hereby not to become as foolish as Śṛṅgi and be always on guard against the demoniac qualities which they had in their previous births. The foolish boy wasof courseexcused by the Lordbut otherswho may not have a father like Śamīka Ṛṣiwill be put into great difficulty if they misuse the advantages obtained by birth in a brāhmaṇa family."
