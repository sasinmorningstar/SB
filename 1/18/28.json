He should not be given a chance to understand that he has come into the house of an enemy. When Lord Kṛṣṇaaccompanied by Arjuna and Bhīmaapproached Jarāsandha in Magadhathe respectable enemies were given a royal reception by King Jarāsandha. The guest enemynamely Bhīmawas to fight with Jarāsandhaand yet they were given a grand reception. At night they used to sit down together as friends and guestsand in the day they used to fightrisking life and death. That was the law of reception. The reception law enjoins that a poor manwho has nothing to offer his guestshould be good enough to offer a straw mat for sittinga glass of water for drinking and some sweet words. Thereforeto receive a guesteither friend or foethere is no expense. It is only a question of good manners."

            "text": "When Mahārāja Parīkṣit entered the door of Śamīka Ṛṣihe did not expect a royal reception by the ṛṣi because he knew that saints and ṛṣis are not materially rich men. But he never expected that a seat of strawa glass of water and some sweet words would be denied to him. He was not an ordinary guestnor was he an enemy of the ṛṣiand therefore the cold reception by the ṛṣi astonished the King greatly. As a matter of factthe King was right to get angry with the ṛṣi when he needed a glass of water very badly. To become angry in such a grave situation was not unnatural for the Kingbut because the King himself was not less than a great sainthis becoming angry and taking action were astonishing. So it must be accepted that it was so ordained by the supreme will of the Lord. The King was a great devotee of the Lordand the saint was also as good as the King. But by the will of the Lordthe circumstances were so created that they became ways to the King's becoming unattached to family connection and governmental activities and thus becoming a completely surrendered soul unto the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The merciful Lord sometimes creates such awkward positions for his pure devotees in order to drag them towards Himself from the mire of material existence. But outwardly the situations appear to be frustrating to the devotees. The devotees of the Lord are always under the protection of the Lordand in any conditionfrustration or successthe Lord is the supreme guide for the devotees. The pure devoteesthereforeaccept all conditions of frustration as blessings from the Lord."
