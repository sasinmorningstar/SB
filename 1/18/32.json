This boy was known as Śṛṅgiand he achieved good training in brahmacarya by his father so that he could be as powerful as a brāhmaṇaeven at that age. But because the age of Kali was seeking an opportunity to spoil the cultural heritage of the four orders of lifethe inexperienced boy gave a chance for the age of Kali to enter into the field of Vedic culture. Hatred of the lower orders of life began from this brāhmaṇa boyunder the influence of Kaliand thus cultural life began to dwindle day after day. The first victim of brahminical injustice was Mahārāja Parīkṣitand thus the protection given by the King against the onslaught of Kali was slackened."
