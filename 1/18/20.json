    "translation": "\nIt is now ascertained that He [the Personality of Godhead] is unlimited and there is none equal to Him. Consequently no one can speak of Him adequately. Great demigods cannot obtain the favor of the goddess of fortune even by prayers, but this very goddess renders service unto the Lord, although He is unwilling to have such service.\n\n",

He has unlimited potenciesand His every action is carried out systematically in His natural and perfect ways. Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in Himselfand He has nothing to accept from anyone elseincluding the great demigods like Brahmā. Others ask for the favor of the goddess of fortuneand despite such prayers she declines to award such favors. But still she renders service unto the Supreme Personality of Godheadalthough He has nothing to accept from her. The Personality of Godhead in His Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu feature begets Brahmāthe first created person in the material worldfrom His navel lotus stem and not in the womb of the goddess of fortunewho is eternally engaged in His service. These are some of the instances of His complete independence and perfection. That He has nothing to do does not mean that He is impersonal. He is transcendentally so full of inconceivable potencies that simply by His willingeverything is done without physical or personal endeavor. He is calledthereforeYogeśvaraor the Lord of all mystic powers."
