    "translation": "\nMahārāja Parīkṣit was a realist, like the bees who only accept the essence [of a flower]. He knew perfectly well that in this age of Kali, auspicious things produce good effects immediately, whereas inauspicious acts must be actually performed [to render effects]. So he was never envious of the personality of Kali.\n\n",

            "text": "The age of Kali is called the fallen age. In this fallen agebecause the living beings are in an awkward positionthe Supreme Lord has given some special facilities to them. So by the will of the Lorda living being does not become a victim of a sinful act until the act is actually performed. In other agessimply by thinking of performing a sinful actone used to become a victim of the act. On the contrarya living being in this age is awarded with the results of pious acts simply by thinking of them. Mahārāja Parīkṣitbeing the most learned and experienced king by the grace of the Lordwas not unnecessarily envious of the personality of Kali because he did not intend to give him any chance to perform any sinful act. He protected his subjects from falling prey to the sinful acts of the age of Kaliand at the same time he gave full facility to the age of Kali by allotting him some particular places. At the end of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is said that even though all nefarious activities of the personality of Kali are presentthere is a great advantage in the age of Kali. One can attain salvation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord. Thus Mahārāja Parīkṣit made an organized effort to propagate the chanting of the Lord's holy nameand thus he saved the citizens from the clutches of Kali. It is for this advantage only that great sages sometimes wish all good for the age of Kali. In the Vedas also it is said that by discourse on Lord Kṛṣṇa's activitiesone can get rid of all the disadvantages of the age of Kali. In the beginning of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam it is also said that by the recitation of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamthe Supreme Lord becomes at once arrested within one's heart. These are some of the great advantages of the age of Kaliand Mahārāja Parīkṣit took all the advantages and did not think any ill of the age of Kalitrue to his Vaiṣṇavite cult."
