The ṛṣi did not congratulate his son, but, on the contrary, began to repent, saying: Alas! What a great sinful act was performed by my son. He has awarded heavy punishment for an insignificant offense.\n\n",

The king may order hanging of a culprit son of a brāhmaṇabut he does not become sinful for killing a brāhmaṇa. Even if there is something wrong with the kinghe is never to be condemned. A medical practitioner may kill a patient by mistaken treatmentbut such a killer is never condemned to death. So what to speak of a good and pious king like Mahārāja Parīkṣit? In the Vedic way of lifethe king is trained to become a rājarṣior a great saintalthough he is ruling as king. It is the king only by whose good government the citizens can live peacefully and without any fear. The rājarṣis would manage their kingdoms so nicely and piously that their subjects would respect them as if they were the Lord. That is the instruction of the Vedas. The king is called narendraor the best amongst the human beings. How then could a king like Mahārāja Parīkṣit be condemned by an inexperiencedpuffed-up son of a brahmaṇaeven though he had attained the powers of a qualified brāhmaṇa?"

The king was beyond the jurisdiction of curses as a general ruleand what to speak of a good king like Mahārāja Parīkṣit. The offense of the King was most insignificantand his being condemned to death was certainly a very great sin for Śṛṅgi. Therefore Ṛṣi Śamīka regretted the whole incident."
