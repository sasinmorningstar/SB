The Vedic civilization's destination is to go back to Godheadback homewhere there is no birthno deathno old age and no disease. The Vedas direct everyone not to remain in the darkness of the material world but to go towards the light of the spiritual kingdom far beyond the material sky. The qualitative caste system and the orders of life are scientifically planned by the Lord and His representativesthe great ṛṣis. The perfect way of life gives all sorts of instruction in things both material and spiritual. The Vedic way of life does not allow any man to be like the monkeys and dogs. A degraded civilization of sense gratification and economic development is the by-product of a godless or kingless government of the peopleby the peopleand for the people. The people should notthereforebegrudge the poor administrations they themselves elect."
