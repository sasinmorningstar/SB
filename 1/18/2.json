For him nothing is as important as the Supreme Lordand thus he gives equal importance to heaven and hell. He knows well that both heaven and hell are creations of the Lordand similarly life and death are different conditions of existence created by the Lord. But in all conditions and in all circumstancesremembrance of Nārāyaṇa is essential. The nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa practices this constantly. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was such a pure devotee. He was wrongfully cursed by an inexperienced son of a brāhmaṇawho was under the influence of Kaliand Mahārāja Parīkṣit took this to be sent by Nārāyaṇa. He knew that Nārāyaṇa (Lord Kṛṣṇa) had saved him when he was burned in the womb of his motherand if he were to be killed by a snake biteit would also take place by the will of the Lord. The devotee never goes against the will of the Lord; anything sent by God is a blessing for the devotee. Therefore Mahārāja Parīkṣit was neither afraid of nor bewildered by such things. That is the sign of a pure devotee of the Lord."
