Can anyone who is expert in relishing nectar [rasa] ever be fully satiated by hearing topics about Him?\n\n",

For exampleLord Śiva drank an ocean of poison of which one drop was sufficient to kill an ordinary living being. SimilarlyBrahmā could create many powerful demigodsincluding Lord Śiva. So they are īśvarasor lords of the universe. But they are not the supreme powerful. The supreme powerful is GovindaLord Kṛṣṇa. He is the Transcendenceand His transcendental attributes cannot be measured even by such powerful īśvaras as Śiva and Brahmā. Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa is the exclusive shelter of the greatest of all living beings. Brahmā is counted amongst the living beingsbut he is the greatest of all of us. And why is the greatest of all the living beings so much attached to the transcendental topics of Lord Kṛṣṇa? Because He is the reservoir of all enjoyment. Everyone wants to relish some kind of taste in everythingbut one who is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord can derive unlimited pleasure from such engagement. The Lord is unlimitedand His nameattributespastimesentouragevariegatednessetc. are unlimitedand those who relish them can do so unlimitedly and still not feel satiated. This fact is confirmed in the Padma Purāṇa:"

Sūta Gosvāmī desired to continue the topics of Lord Kṛṣṇa before the sages of Naimiṣāraṇyaand the sages also expressed their readiness to hear from him continuously. Since the Lord is transcendence and His attributes are transcendentalsuch discourses increase the receptive mood of the purified audience."
