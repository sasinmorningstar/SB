            "text": "The brāhmaṇas are considered to be the head and brains of the social bodyand the kṣatriyas are considered to be the arms of the social body. The arms are required to protect the body from all harmbut the arms must act according to the directions of the head and brain. That is a natural arrangement made by the supreme orderfor it is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā that four social orders or castesnamely the brāhmaṇasthe kṣatriyasthe vaiśyas and the śūdrasare set up according to quality and work done by them. Naturally the son of a brāhmaṇa has a good chance to become a brāhmaṇa by the direction of his qualified fatheras a son of a medical practitioner has a very good chance to become a qualified medical practitioner. So the caste system is quite scientific. The son must take advantage of the father's qualification and thus become a brāhmaṇa or medical practitionerand not otherwise. Without being qualifiedone cannot become a brāhmaṇa or medical practitionerand that is the verdict of all scriptures and social orders. Herein Śṛṅgia qualified son of a great brāhmaṇaattained the required brahminical power both by birth and by trainingbut he was lacking in culture because he was an inexperienced boy. By the influence of Kalithe son of a brāhmaṇa became puffed up with brahminical power and thus wrongly compared Mahārāja Parīkṣit to crows and watchdogs. The King is certainly the watchdog of the state in the sense that he keeps vigilant eyes over the border of the state for its protection and defensebut to address him as a watchdog is the sign of a less-cultured boy. Thus the downfall of the brahminical powers began as they gave importance to birthright without culture. The downfall of the brāhmaṇa caste began in the age of Kali. And since brāhmaṇas are the heads of the social orderall other orders of society also began to deteriorate. This beginning of brahminical deterioration was highly deplored by the father of Śṛṅgias we will find."
