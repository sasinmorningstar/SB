The sage rightly takes the responsibility of the brāhmaṇas as a community for killing monarchical government and thus giving an opportunity to the so-called democratswho are generally plunderers of the wealth of the state subjects. The so-called democrats capture the administrative machine without assuming responsibility for the prosperous condition of the citizens. Everyone captures the post for personal gratificationand thus instead of one kinga number of irresponsible kings grow up to tax the citizens. It is foretold herein that in the absence of good monarchical governmenteveryone will be the cause of disturbance for others by plundering richesanimalswomenetc."
