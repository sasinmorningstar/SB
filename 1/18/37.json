The brāhmaṇa boy considered Mahārāja Parīkṣit to be kulāṅgāraor the wretched of the dynastybut factually the brāhmaṇa boy himself was so because only from him did the brāhmaṇa caste become powerlesslike the snake whose poisoned teeth are broken. The snake is fearful as long as his poison teeth are thereotherwise he is fearful only to children. The personality of Kali conquered the brāhmaṇa boy firstand gradually the other castes. Thus the whole scientific system of the orders of society in this age has assumed the form of a vitiated caste systemwhich is now being uprooted by another class of men similarly influenced by the age of Kali. One should see to the root cause of vitiation and not try to condemn the system as it iswithout knowledge of its scientific value."
