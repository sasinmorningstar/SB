A brahmacārīor studentshould perform sacrificesa householder should give charityand a person in the retired life or in the renounced order should practice penances and austerities. Those are the general functions of all the āśramasor orders of life on the path of self-realization. In the brahmacārī life the training is sufficiently imparted so that one may understand that the world as property belongs to the Supreme Lordthe Personality of Godhead. No onethereforecan claim to be the proprietor of anything in the world. Thereforein the life of a householderwhich is a sort of license for sex enjoymentone must give in charity for the service of the Lord. Everyone's energy is generated or borrowed from the reservoir of energy of the Lord; thereforethe resultant actions of such energy must be given to the Lord in the shape of transcendental loving service for Him. As the rivers draw water from the sea through the clouds and again go down to the seasimilarly our energy is borrowed from the supreme sourcethe Lord's energyand it must return to the Lord. That is the perfection of our energy. The Lordthereforein the Bhagavad-gītā  says that whatever we dowhatever we undergo as penancewhatever we sacrificewhatever we eat or whatever we give in charity must be offered to Him (the Lord). That is the way of utilizing our borrowed energy. When our energy is utilized in that wayour energy is purified from the contamination of material inebrietiesand thus we become fit for our original natural life of service to the Lord."

They were trained to perform different sacrifices only for the prosperity of the subjects. To lead the prajās to the attainment of salvation was a great duty of the king. The fatherthe spiritual master and the king are not to become irresponsible in the matter of leading their subjects to the path of ultimate liberation from birthdeathdiseases and old age. When these primary duties are properly dischargedthere is no need of government of the peopleby the people. In modern days the people in general occupy the administration by the strength of manipulated votesbut they are never trained in the primary duties of the kingand that is also not possible for everyone. Under the circumstances the untrained administrators play havoc to make the subjects happy in all respects. On the other handthese untrained administrators gradually become rogues and thieves and increase the taxation to finance a top-heavy administration that is useless for all purposes. Actually the qualified brāhmaṇas are meant to give direction to the kings for proper administration in terms of the scriptures like the Manu-saṁhitā and Dharma-śāstras of Parāśara. A typical king is the ideal of the people in generaland if the king is piousreligiouschivalrous and munificentthe citizens generally follow him. Such a king is not a lazy sensuous person living at the cost of the subjectsbut alert always to kill thieves and dacoits. The pious kings were not merciful to dacoits and thieves in the name of nonsensical ahiṁsā (nonviolence). The thieves and dacoits were punished in an exemplary way so that in the future no one would dare commit such nuisances in an organized form. Such thieves and dacoits were never meant for administration as they are now."

One would never grudge parting with it because due to the pious king and religious harmony there was enough natural wealthnamely grainsfruitsflowerssilkcottonmilkjewelsmineralsetc.and therefore no one was materially unhappy.

The whole government was specifically designed to fulfill this particular purpose. As suchthe king had to select properly the cabinet ministersbut not on the strength of voting background. The ministersthe military commanders and even the ordinary soldiers were all selected by personal qualificationand the king had to supervise them properly before they were appointed to their respective posts. The king was especially vigilant to see that the tapasvīsor persons who sacrificed everything for disseminating spiritual knowledgewere never disregarded. The king knew well that the Supreme Personality of Godhead never tolerates any insult to His unalloyed devotees. Such tapasvīs were trusted leaders even of the rogues and thieveswho would never disobey the orders of tapasvīs. The king would give special protection to illiteratesthe helpless and widows of the state. Defense measures were arranged previous to any attack by the enemies. The taxing process was easyand it was not meant for squanderingbut was for strengthening the reserve fund. The soldiers were recruited from all parts of the worldand they were trained for special duties."

We are all eternal servants of the Lordand when we forget this essential part of our nature we are put into material conditions of life. The simple process of pleasing the Lord (for the householders especially) is to install the Deity of the Lord at home. By concentrating on the Deityone may progressively go on with the daily routine work. Worshiping the Deity at homeserving the devoteehearing the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamresiding in a holy place and chanting the holy name of the Lord are all inexpensive items by which one can please the Lord. Thus the subject matter was explained by the grandfather to his grandchildren."
