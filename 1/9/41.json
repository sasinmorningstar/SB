This happened during my presence, and I remembered the incident in order to keep my mind upon the Lord.\n\n",

The emperorin those daysupon his ascendance to the thronewould send a challenge horse all over the world to declare his supremacyand any ruling prince or king was at liberty to accept the challenge and express his tacit willingness either to obey or to disobey the supremacy of the particular emperor. One who accepted the challenge had to fight with the emperor and establish his own supremacy by victory. The defeated challenger would have to sacrifice his lifemaking a place for another king or ruler. So Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira also dispatched such challenging horses all over the worldand every ruling prince and king all over the world accepted Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's leadership as the Emperor of the world. After thisall rulers of the world under the regime of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira were invited to participate in the great sacrificial ceremony of Rājasūya. Such performances required hundreds of millions of dollarsand it was not an easy job for a petty king. Such a sacrificial ceremonybeing too expensive and also difficult to perform under present circumstancesis now impossible in this age of Kali. Nor can anyone secure the required expert priesthood to take charge of the ceremony."

The learned societyincluding the great philosophersreligionistsphysiciansscientists and all great sageswas invited. That is to saythe brāhmaṇas and the kṣatriyas were the topmost leading men in societyand they were all invited to participate in the assembly. The vaiśyas and śūdras were unimportant elements in societyand they are not mentioned herein. Due to the change of social activities in the modern agethe importance of men has also changed in terms of occupational positions."

Bhīṣmadeva remembered all this and was glad that his worshipful Lordthe Personality of Godheadwas present before him in His actual formal presence. So to meditate on the Supreme Lord is to meditate on the activitiesformpastimesname and fame of the Lord. That is easier than what is imagined as meditation on the impersonal feature of the Supreme. In the Bhagavad-gītā . The Lord is nondifferent from His transcendental activities. It is indicated also in this śloka that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇawhile actually present before human societyespecially in connection with the Battle of Kurukṣetrawas accepted as the greatest personality of the timealthough He might not have been recognized as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The propaganda that a very great man is worshiped as God after his death is misleading because a man after his death cannot be made into God. Nor can the Personality of Godhead be a human beingeven when He is personally present. Both ideas are misconceptions. The idea of anthropomorphism cannot be applicable in the case of Lord Kṛṣṇa."
