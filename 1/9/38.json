            "text": "The dealings of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Bhīṣmadeva on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra are interesting because the activities of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared to be partial to Arjuna and at enmity with Bhīṣmadeva; but factually all this was especially meant to show special favor to Bhīṣmadevaa great devotee of the Lord. The astounding feature of such dealings is that a devotee can please the Lord by playing the part of an enemy. The Lordbeing absolutecan accept service from His pure devotee even in the garb of an enemy. The Supreme Lord cannot have any enemynor can a so-called enemy harm Him because He is ajitaor unconquerable. But still He takes pleasure when His pure devotee beats Him like an enemy or rebukes Him from a superior positionalthough no one can be superior to the Lord. These are some of the transcendental reciprocatory dealings of the devotee with the Lord. And those who have no information of pure devotional service cannot penetrate into the mystery of such dealings. Bhīṣmadeva played the part of a valiant warriorand he purposely pierced the body of the Lord so that to the common eyes it appeared that the Lord was woundedbut factually all this was to bewilder the nondevotees. The all-spiritual body cannot be woundedand a devotee cannot become the enemy of the Lord. Had it been soBhīṣmadeva would not have desired to have the very same Lord as the ultimate destination of his life. Had Bhīṣmadeva been an enemy of the LordLord Kṛṣṇa could have annihilated him without even moving. There was no need to come before Bhīṣmadeva with blood and wounds. But He did so because the warrior devotee wanted to see the transcendental beauty of the Lord decorated with wounds created by a pure devotee. This is the way of exchanging transcendental rasaor relations between the Lord and the servitor. By such dealings both the Lord and the devotee become glorified in their respective positions. The Lord was so angry that Arjuna checked Him when He was moving towards Bhīṣmadevabut in spite of Arjuna's checkingHe proceeded towards Bhīṣmadeva as a lover goes to a loverwithout caring for hindrances. Apparently His determination was to kill Bhīṣmadevabut factually it was to please him as a great devotee of the Lord. The Lord is undoubtedly the deliverer of all conditioned souls. The impersonalists desire salvation from Himand He always awards them according to their aspirationbut here Bhīṣmadeva aspires to see the Lord in His personal feature. All pure devotees aspire for this."
