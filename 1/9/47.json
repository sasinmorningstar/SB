Due to unalloyed love and devotion for the Lordthe devotees always see Him within themselvesand the Lord alsoalthough He has nothing to do and nothing to aspire tois always busy in attending to the welfare of His devotees. For the ordinary living beings the law of nature is there for all actions and reactionsbut He is always anxious to put His devotees on the right path. The devoteesthereforeare under the direct care of the Lord. And the Lord also voluntarily puts Himself under the care of His devotees only. So all the sagesheaded by Vyāsadevawere devotees of the Lordand therefore they chanted the Vedic hymns after the funeral ceremony just to please the Lordwho was present there personally. All the Vedic hymns are chanted to please Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā . All the VedasUpaniṣadsVedāntaetc.are seeking Him onlyand all hymns are for glorifying Him only. The sagesthereforeperformed the exact acts suitable for the purposeand they happily departed for their respective hermitages."
