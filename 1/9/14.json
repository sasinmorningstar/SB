All the big gigantic planetsincluding the sunare being controlled by the force of airas the clouds are carried by the force of air. Similarlythe inevitable kālaor timecontrols even the action of the air and other elements. Everythingthereforeis controlled by the supreme kālaa forceful representative of the Lord within the material world. Thus Yudhiṣṭhira should not be sorry for the inconceivable action of time. Everyone has to bear the actions and reactions of time as long as one is within the conditions of the material world. Yudhiṣṭhira should not think that he had committed sins in his previous birth and is suffering the consequence. Even the most pious has to suffer the condition of material nature. But a pious man is faithful to the Lordfor he is guided by the bona fide brāhmaṇa and Vaiṣṇava following the religious principles. These three guiding principles should be the aim of life. One should not be disturbed by the tricks of eternal time. Even the great controller of the universeBrahmājīis also under the control of that time; thereforeone should not grudge being thus controlled by time despite being a true follower of religious principles."
