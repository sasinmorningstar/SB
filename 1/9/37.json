            "text": "The Battle of Kurukṣetra was fought on military principles but at the same time in a sporting spiritlike a friend's fight with another friend. Duryodhana criticized Bhīṣmadevaalleging that he was reluctant to kill Arjuna because of paternal affection. A kṣatriya cannot tolerate insults on the principle of fighting. Bhīṣmadeva therefore promised that the next day he would kill all five Pāṇḍavas with special weapons made for the purpose. Duryodhana was satisfiedand he kept the arrows with him to be delivered the next day during the fight. By tricks Arjuna took the arrows from Duryodhanaand Bhīṣmadeva could understand that this was the trick of Lord Kṛṣṇa. So he took a vow that the next day Kṛṣṇa would have to take up weapons Himselfotherwise His friend Arjuna would die. In the next day's fighting Bhīṣmadeva fought so violently that both Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa were in trouble. Arjuna was almost defeated; the situation was so tense that he was about to be killed by Bhīṣmadeva the very next moment. At that time Lord Kṛṣṇa wanted to please His devoteeBhīṣmaby keeping Bhīṣma's promisewhich was more important than His own. Seemingly He broke His own promise. He promised before the beginning of the Battle of Kurukṣetra that He would remain without weapons and would not use His strength for either of the parties. But to protect Arjuna He got down from the chariottook up the wheel of the chariot and hurriedly rushed at Bhīṣmadeva in an angry moodas a lion goes to kill an elephant. He dropped His covering cloth on the wayand out of great anger He did not know that He had dropped it. Bhīṣmadeva at once gave up his weapons and stood to be killed by Kṛṣṇahis beloved Lord. The fighting of the day was thus ended at that very momentand Arjuna was saved. Of course there was no possibility of Arjuna's death because the Lord Himself was on the chariotbut because Bhīṣmadeva wanted to see Lord Kṛṣṇa take up some weapon to save His friendthe Lord created this situationmaking Arjuna's death imminent. He stood before Bhīṣmadeva to show him that his promise was fulfilled and that He had taken up the wheel."
