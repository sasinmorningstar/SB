Such knowledge is never dogmaticas ill conceived by less intelligent persons. The mother is the authority to verify the identity of the father. She is the authority for such confidential knowledge. Thereforeauthority is not dogmatic. In the Bhagavad-gītā this truth is confirmed in the Fourth Chapter and the perfect system of learning is to receive it from authority. The very same system is accepted universally as truthbut only the false arguer speaks against it. For examplemodern spacecraft fly in the skyand when scientists say that they travel to the other side of the moonmen believe these stories blindly because they have accepted the modern scientists as authorities. The authorities speakand the people in general believe them. But in the case of Vedic truthsthey have been taught not to believe. Even if they accept them they give a different interpretation. Each and every man wants a direct perception of Vedic knowledgebut foolishly they deny it. This means that the misguided man can believe one authoritythe scientistbut will reject the authority of the Vedas. The result is that people have degenerated."

Even such an impersonalist as Ācārya Śaṅkara has said in the beginning of his commentation on the Bhagavad-gītā that Nārāyaṇathe Personality of Godheadis beyond the material creation. The universe is one of the material creationsbut Nārāyaṇa is transcendental to such material paraphernalia."

His confirmation of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa's being the original Personality of Godhead is also corroborated by the impersonalist Śaṅkara. All other ācāryas have also confirmed this statementand thus there is no chance of not accepting Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa as the original Personality of Godhead. Bhīṣmadeva says that He is the first Nārāyaṇa. This is also confirmed by Brahmājī in the Bhāgavatam . Kṛṣṇa is the first Nārāyaṇa. In the spiritual world (Vaikuṇṭha) there are unlimited numbers of Nārāyaṇaswho are all the same Personality of Godhead and are considered to be the plenary expansions of the original Personality of GodheadŚrī Kṛṣṇa. The first form of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa first expands Himself as the form of Baladevaand Baladeva expands in so many other formssuch as SaṅkarṣaṇaPradyumnaAniruddhaVāsudevaNārāyaṇaPuruṣaRāma and Nṛsiṁha. All these expansions are one and the same viṣṇu-tattvaand Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original source of all the plenary expansions. He is therefore the direct Personality of Godhead. He is the creator of the material worldand He is the predominating Deity known as Nārāyaṇa in all the Vaikuṇṭha planets. ThereforeHis movements amongst human beings is another sort of bewilderment. The Lord therefore says in the Bhagavad-gītā that foolish persons consider Him to be one of the human beings without knowing the intricacies of His movements."

            "text": "The bewilderment regarding Śrī Kṛṣṇa is due to the action of His twofold internal and external energies upon the third onecalled marginal energy. The living entities are expansions of His marginal energyand thus they are sometimes bewildered by the internal energy and sometimes by the external energy. By internal energetic bewildermentŚrī Kṛṣṇa expands Himself into unlimited numbers of Nārāyaṇas and exchanges or accepts transcendental loving service from the living entities in the transcendental world. And by His external energetic expansionsHe incarnates Himself in the material world amongst the menanimals or demigods to reestablish His forgotten relation with the living entities in different species of life. Great authorities like Bhīṣmahoweverescape His bewilderment by the mercy of the Lord."
