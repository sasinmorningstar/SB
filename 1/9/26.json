In almost all the Purāṇas the subject matter is described in the same spiritand so also in the Mahābhārata it is more elaborately described by Bhīṣmadeva in the Śānti-parvabeginning from the sixtieth chapter."

Self-realization is distinguished from the life of the lower animals engaged in eatingsleepingfearing and mating. Bhīṣmadeva advised for all human beings nine qualifications: (1) not to become angry(2) not to lie(3) to equally distribute wealth(4) to forgive(5) to beget children only by one's legitimate wife(6) to be pure in mind and hygienic in body(7) not to be inimical toward anyone(8) to be simpleand (9) to support servants or subordinates. One cannot be called a civilized person without acquiring the above-mentioned preliminary qualities. Besides thesethe brāhmaṇas (the intelligent men)the administrative menthe mercantile community and the laborer class must acquire special qualities in terms of occupational duties mentioned in all the Vedic scriptures. For the intelligent mencontrolling the senses is the most essential qualification. It is the basis of morality. Sex indulgence even with a legitimate wife must also be controlledand thereby family control will automatically follow. An intelligent man abuses his great qualifications if he does not follow the Vedic way of life. This means he must seriously make a study of the Vedic literaturesespecially of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and the Bhagavad-gītā. For learning Vedic knowledgeone must approach a person who is cent percent engaged in devotional service. He must not do things which are forbidden in the śāstras. A person cannot be a teacher if he drinks or smokes. In the modern system of education the teacher's academic qualification is taken into consideration without evaluation of his moral life. Thereforethe result of education is misuse of high intelligence in so many ways."

Modern administrators raise subscriptions for some political functionsbut never give charity to the citizens in any state function. It is just the reverse in the injunctions of the śāstras. The administrative class must be well versed in the śāstrasbut must not take to the profession of teachers. The administrators should never pretend to become nonviolent and thereby go to hell. When Arjuna wanted to become a nonviolent coward on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetrahe was severely chastised by Lord Kṛṣṇa. The Lord degraded Arjuna at that time to the status of an uncivilized man for his avowed acceptance of the cult of nonviolence. The administrative class must be personally trained in military education. Cowards should not be elevated to the presidential throne by dint of numerical votes only. The monarchs were all chivalrous personalitiesand therefore monarchy should be maintained provided the monarch is regularly trained in the occupational duties of a king. In fightingthe king or the president should never return home without being hurt by the enemy. The so-called king of today never visits the warfield. He is very much expert in artificially encouraging the fighting strength in the hope of false national prestige. As soon as the administrative class is turned into a gang of mercantile and laborer menthe whole machinery of government becomes polluted."

Agriculture and distribution of the foodstuff are the primary duties of the mercantile community backed by education in Vedic knowledge and trained to give in charity. As the kṣatriyas were given charge of the protection of the citizensvaiśyas were given the charge of the protection of animals. Animals are never meant to be killed. Killing of animals is a symptom of barbarian society. For a human beingagricultural producefruits and milk are sufficient and compatible foodstuffs. The human society should give more attention to animal protection. The productive energy of the laborer is misused when he is occupied by industrial enterprises. Industry of various types cannot produce the essential needs of mannamely ricewheatgrainsmilkfruits and vegetables. The production of machines and machine tools increases the artificial living fashion of a class of vested interests and keeps thousands of men in starvation and unrest. This should not be the standard of civilization."

The śūdra class can attain all comforts of life simply by rendering service to the higher classes. It is especially enjoined that a śūdra should never bank money. As soon as the śūdras accumulate wealthit will be misused for sinful activities in winewomen and gambling. Winewomen and gambling indicate that the population is degraded to less than śūdra quality. The higher castes should always look after the maintenance of the śūdrasand they should provide them with old and used garments. A śūdra should not leave his master when the master is old and invalidand the master should keep the servants satisfied in all respects. The śūdras must first of all be satisfied by sumptuous food and clothing before any sacrifice is performed. In this age so many functions are held by spending millionsbut the poor laborer is not sumptuously fed or given charityclothingetc. The laborers are thus dissatisfiedand so they make agitation."

Both are interrelatedand one is dependent on the other. The main purpose of āśrama-dharma is to awaken knowledge and detachment. The brahmacārī āśrama is the training ground for the prospective candidates. In this āśrama it is instructed that this material world is not actually the home of the living being. The conditioned souls under material bondage are prisoners of matterand therefore self-realization is the ultimate aim of life. The whole system of āśrama-dharma is a means to detachment. One who fails to assimilate this spirit of detachment is allowed to enter into family life with the same spirit of detachment. Thereforeone who attains detachment may at once adopt the fourth ordernamelyrenouncedand thus live on charity onlynot to accumulate wealthbut just to keep body and soul together for ultimate realization. Household life is for one who is attachedand the vānaprastha and sannyāsa orders of life are for those who are detached from material life. The brahmacārī-āśrama is especially meant for training both the attached and detached."
