They are also spacemen competent to travel in the air without the help of any material vehicle. Parvata Muni is also a devarṣior a great sage amongst the demigodslike Nārada. He was present along with Nārada at the sacrificial ceremony of Mahārāja Janamejayason of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. In this sacrifice all the snakes of the world were to be killed. Parvata Muni and Nārada Muni are called Gandharvas also because they can travel in the air singing the glories of the Lord. Since they can travel in the airthey observed Draupadī's svayaṁvara ceremony (selecting of her own husband) from the air. Like Nārada MuniParvata Muni also used to visit the royal assembly in the heaven of King Indra. As a Gandharvasometimes he visited the royal assembly of Kuveraone of the important demigods. Both Nārada and Parvata were once in trouble with the daughter of Mahārāja Sṛñjaya. Mahārāja Sṛñjaya got the benediction of a son by Parvata Muni."

In his previous life he was the son of a maidservantbut by good association with pure devotees he became enlightened in devotional serviceand in the next life he became a perfect man comparable with himself only. In the Mahābhārata his name is mentioned in many places. He is the principle devarṣior the chief sage amongst the demigods. He is the son and disciple of Brahmājīand from him the disciplic succession in the line of Brahmā has been spread. He initiated Prahlāda MahārājaDhruva Mahārāja and many celebrated devotees of the Lord. He initiated even Vyāsadevathe author of the Vedic literaturesand from VyāsadevaMadhvācārya was initiatedand thus the Madhva-sampradāyain which the Gauḍīya-sampradāya is also includedhas spread all over the universe. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu belonged to this Madhva-sampradāya; thereforeBrahmājīNāradaVyāsadown to MadhvaCaitanya and the Gosvāmīs all belonged to the same line of disciplic succession. Nāradajī has instructed many kings from time immemorial. In the Bhāgavatam we can see that he instructed Prahlāda Mahārāja while he was in the womb of his motherand he instructed Vasudevafather of Kṛṣṇaas well as Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira."

He acted as the priest in many religious functions of the Pāṇḍavas (saṁskāra)and also each of the Pāṇḍavas was attended by him at the betrothal of Draupadī. He was present even during the exile of the Pāṇḍavas and used to advise them in circumstances when they were perplexed. He instructed them how to live incognito for one yearand his instructions were strictly followed by the Pāṇḍavas during that time. His name is mentioned also when the general funeral ceremony was performed after the Battle of Kurukṣetra. In the Anuṣāsana-parva of Mahābhārata (127.15-16)he gave religious instructions very elaborately to Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. He was actually the right type of priest of a householderfor he could guide the Pāṇḍavas on the right path of religion. A priest is meant for guiding the householder progressively in the right path of āśrama-dharmaor the occupational duty of a particular caste. There is practically no difference between the family priest and the spiritual master. The sagessaints and brāhmaṇas were especially meant for such functions."

Śukadeva Gosvāmī was his sonand ṛṣis like Vaiśampāyana were his disciples for different branches of the Vedas. He is the author of the great epic Mahābhārata and the great transcendental literature Bhāgavatam. The Brahma-sūtras—the Vedānta-sūtrasor Bādarāyaṇa-sūtras—were compiled by him. Amongst sages he is the most respected author by dint of severe penances. When he wanted to record the great epic Mahābhārata for the welfare of all people in the age of Kalihe was feeling the necessity of a powerful writer who could take up his dictation. By the order of BrahmājīŚrī Gaṇeśajī took up the charge of noting down the dictation on the condition that Vyāsadeva would not stop dictation for a moment. The Mahābhārata was thus compiled by the joint endeavor of Vyāsa and Gaṇeśa."
