    "translation": "\nAt the moment of death, let my ultimate attraction be to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead. I concentrate my mind upon the chariot driver of Arjuna who stood with a whip in His right hand and a bridle rope in His left, who was very careful to give protection to Arjuna's chariot by all means. Those who saw Him on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra attained their original forms after death.\n\n",

Such a pure devotee cannot forget the Lord for a moment. This is called trance. The mystic (yogī) tries to concentrate upon the Supersoul by controlling the senses from all other engagementsand thus he ultimately attains samādhi. A devotee more easily attains samādhior tranceby constantly remembering the Lord's personal feature along with His holy namefamepastimesetc. Thereforethe concentration of the mystic yogī and that of the devotee are not on the same level. The concentration of the mystic is mechanicalwhereas that of the pure devotee is natural in pure love and spontaneous affection. Bhīṣmadeva was a pure devoteeand as a military marshal he constantly remembered the battlefield feature of the Lord as Pārtha-sārathithe chariot driver of Arjuna. Thereforethe Lord's pastime as Pārtha-sārathi is also eternal. The pastimes of the Lordbeginning from His birth at the prison house of Kaṁsa up to the mausala-līlā at the endall move one after another in all the universesjust as the clock hand moves from one point to another. And in such pastimes His associates like the Pāṇḍavas and Bhīṣma are constant eternal companions. So Bhīṣmadeva never forgot the beautiful feature of the Lord as Pārtha-sārathiwhich even Arjuna could not see. Arjuna was behind the beautiful Pārtha-sārathi while Bhīṣmadeva was just in front of the Lord. As far as the military feature of the Lord is concernedBhīṣmadeva observed this with more relish than Arjuna."

            "text": "All the soldiers and persons on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra attained their original spiritual form like the Lord after their death because by the causeless mercy of the Lord they were able to see Him face to face on that occasion. The conditioned souls rotating in the evolutionary cycle from the aquatics up to the form of Brahmā are all in the form of māyāor the form obtained by one's own actions and awarded by material nature. The material forms of the conditioned souls are all foreign dressesand when the conditioned soul becomes liberated from the clutches of material energyhe attains his original form. The impersonalist wants to attain the impersonal Brahman effulgence of the Lordbut that is not at all congenial to the living sparksparts and parcels of the Lord. Thereforethe impersonalists again fall down and get material formswhich are all false to the spirit soul. A spiritual form like the Lord'seither two-handed or four-handedis attained by the devotees of the Lord either in the Vaikuṇṭhas or in the Goloka planetaccording to the original nature of the soul. This formwhich is cent percent spiritualis the svarūpa of the living beingand all the living beings who participated on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetraon both sidesattained their svarūpaas confirmed by Bhīṣmadeva. So Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was not merciful only to the Pāṇḍavas; He was also merciful to the other parties because all of them attained the same result. Bhīṣmadeva wanted the same facility alsoand that was his prayer to the Lordalthough his position as an associate of the Lord is assured in all circumstances. The conclusion is that whoever dies looking on the Personality of Godhead within or without attains his svarūpawhich is the highest perfection of life."
