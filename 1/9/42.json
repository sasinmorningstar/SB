He is in everyone's heart. The sun may be perceived differently, but the sun is one.\n\n",

The conception of duality is due to ignorance of His inconceivable energy. In the Bhagavad-gītā  that Vāsudeva is all in all in everything and that there is no existence of anything without Vāsudeva. Vāsudevaor Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇais the original Supreme Personas now confirmed by a mahājanaand therefore both the neophytes and the pure devotees must try to follow in his footsteps. That is the way of the devotional line."

Sometimes less intelligent scholars make a mistake and think that the Kṛṣṇa of Vṛndāvana and that of the Battle of Kurukṣetra are different personalities. But for Bhīṣmadeva this misconception is completely removed. Even the impersonalist's object of destination is Kṛṣṇa as the impersonal jyotiand the yogī's destination of Paramātmā is also Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is both brahmajyoti and localized Paramātmābut in brahmajyoti or Paramātmā there is no Kṛṣṇa or sweet relations with Kṛṣṇa. In His personal feature Kṛṣṇa is both Pārtha-sārathi and Śyāmasundara of Vṛndāvanabut in His impersonal feature He is neither in the brahmajyoti nor in the Paramātmā. Great mahātmās like Bhīṣmadeva realize all these different features of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇaand therefore they worship Lord Kṛṣṇaknowing Him as the origin of all features."
