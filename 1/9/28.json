Such historical factsbeing instructive for ordinary menwere assorted without chronological reference. Besides thatthey happen on different planetsnayin different universesand thus the description of the narrations is sometimes measured by three dimensions. We are simply concerned with the instructive lessons of such incidentseven though they are not in order by our limited range of understanding. Bhīṣmadeva described such narrations before Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira in reply to his different questions."
