Everything and everyone is the manifestation of His energyand thus He is present everywhere by His energybeing nondifferent from it. The sun is identified with every inch of the sun rays and every molecular particle of the rays. Similarlythe Lord is distributed by His different energies. He is Paramātmāor the Supersoulpresent in everyone as the supreme guidanceand therefore He is already the chariot driver and counsel of all living beings. When Hethereforeexhibits Himself as chariot driver of Arjunathere is no change in His exalted position. It is the power of devotional service only that demonstrates Him as the chariot driver or the messenger. Since He has nothing to do with the material conception of life because He is absolute spiritual identitythere is for Him no superior or inferior action. Being the Absolute Personality of GodheadHe has no false egoand so He does not identify Himself with anything different from Him. The material conception of ego is equibalanced in Him. He does not feelthereforeinferior by becoming the chariot driver of His pure devotee. It is the glory of the pure devotee that only he can bring about service from the affectionate Lord."
