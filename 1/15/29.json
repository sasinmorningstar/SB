By such contaminationthe living being is faced with so many compatible and incompatible things that discourage the very existence of spiritual identity. Birth after birth the conditioned soul is entrapped with so many pleasing and displeasing elementswhich are all false and temporary. They accumulate due to our reactions to material desiresbut when we get in touch with the transcendental Lord in His variegated energies by devotional servicethe naked forms of all material desires become manifestand the intelligence of the living being is pacified in its true color. As soon as Arjuna turned his attention towards the instructions of the Lordas they are inculcated in the Bhagavad-gītāhis true color of eternal association with the Lord became manifestand thus he felt freed from all material contaminations."
