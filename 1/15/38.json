Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira trained his grandsonMahārāja Parīkṣitwho was equally qualifiedin state administration in terms of the king's obligation to the citizens. Thus Parīkṣit was enthroned on the seat of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira prior to his departure back to Godhead. Concerning Mahārāja Parīkṣitthe specific word usedvinayinamis significant. Why was the King of Hastināpuraat least till the time of Mahārāja Parīkṣitaccepted as the Emperor of the world? The only reason is that the people of the world were happy because of the good administration of the emperor. The happiness of the citizens was due to the ample production of natural produce such as grainsfruitsmilkherbsvaluable stonesminerals and everything that the people needed. They were even free from all bodily miseriesanxieties of mindand disturbances caused by natural phenomena and other living beings. Because everyone was happy in all respectsthere was no resentmentalthough there were sometimes battles between the state kings for political reasons and supremacy. Everyone was trained to attain the highest goal of lifeand therefore the people were also enlightened enough not to quarrel over trivialities. The influence of the age of Kali gradually infiltrated the good qualities of both the kings and the citizensand therefore a tense situation developed between the ruler and the ruledbut still even in this age of disparity between the ruler and the ruledthere can be spiritual emolument and God consciousness. That is a special prerogative."
