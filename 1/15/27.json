The Lord left behind Him the instructions of the Bhagavad-gītā not for the benefit of Arjuna alonebut also for all time and in all lands. The Bhagavad-gītābeing spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godheadis the essence of all Vedic wisdom. It is nicely presented by the Lord Himself for all who have very little time to go through the vast Vedic literatures like the UpaniṣadsPurāṇas and Vedānta-sūtras. It is put within the study of the great historical epic Mahābhāratawhich was especially prepared for the less intelligent classnamely the womenthe laborers and those who are worthless descendants of the brāhmaṇaskṣatriyas and higher sections of the vaiśyas. The problem which arose in the heart of Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra was solved by the teachings of the Bhagavad-gītā. Againafter the departure of the Lord from the vision of earthly peoplewhen Arjuna was face to face with being vanquished in his acquired power and prominencehe wanted again to remember the great teachings of the Bhagavad-gītā just to teach all concerned that the Bhagavad-gītā can be consulted in all critical timesnot only for solace from all kinds of mental agoniesbut also for the way out of great entanglements which may embarrass one in some critical hour."

            "text": "The merciful Lord left behind Him the great teachings of the Bhagavad-gītā so that one can take the instructions of the Lord even when He is not visible to material eyesight. Material senses cannot have any estimation of the Supreme Lordbut by His inconceivable power the Lord can incarnate Himself to the sense perception of the conditioned souls in a suitable manner through the agency of matterwhich is also another form of the Lord's manifested energy. Thus the Bhagavad-gītāor any authentic scriptural sound representation of the Lordis also the incarnation of the Lord. There is no difference between the sound representation of the Lord and the Lord Himself. One can derive the same benefit from the Bhagavad-gītā as Arjuna did in the personal presence of the Lord."

            "text": "The faithful human being who is desirous of being liberated from the clutches of material existence can very easily take advantage of the Bhagavad-gītāand with this in viewthe Lord instructed Arjuna as if Arjuna were in need of it. In the Bhagavad-gītāfive important factors of knowledge have been delineated pertaining to (1) the Supreme Lord(2) the living being(3) nature(4) time and space and (5) the process of activity. Out of thesethe Supreme Lord and the living being are qualitatively one. The difference between the two has been analyzed as the difference between the whole and the part and parcel. Nature is inert matter displaying the interaction of three different modesand eternal time and unlimited space are considered to be beyond the existence of the material nature. Activities of the living being are different varieties of aptitudes which can entrap or liberate the living being within and without material nature. All these subject matters are concisely discussed in the Bhagavad-gītāand later the subject matters are elaborated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam for further enlightenment. Out of the five subjectsthe Supreme Lordthe living entitynatureand time and space are eternalbut the living entitynature and time are under the direction of the Supreme Lordwho is absolute and completely independent of any other control. The Supreme Lord is the supreme controller. The material activity of the living being is beginninglessbut it can be rectified by transferral into the spiritual quality. Thus it can cease its material qualitative reactions. Both the Lord and the living entity are cognizantand both have the sense of identificationof being conscious as a living force. But the living being under the condition of material naturecalled mahat-tattvamisidentifies himself as being different from the Lord. The whole scheme of Vedic wisdom is targeted to the aim of eradicating such a misconception and thus liberating the living being from the illusion of material identification. When such an illusion is eradicated by knowledge and renunciationthe living beings are responsible actors and enjoyers also. The sense of enjoyment in the Lord is realbut such a sense in the living being is a sort of wishful desire only. This difference in consciousness is the distinction of the two identitiesnamely the Lord and the living being. Otherwise there is no difference between the Lord and the living being. The living being is therefore eternally one and different simultaneously. The whole instruction of the Bhagavad-gītā stands on this principle."

The living being is invited to live in the sanātana existence of the Lordand the process which can help a living being to approach the Lord's abodewhere the liberated activity of the soul is exhibitedis called sanātana-dharma. One cannothoweverreach the eternal abode of the Lord without being free from the misconception of material identificationand the Bhagavad-gītā gives us the clue how to achieve this stage of perfection. The process of being liberated from the misconception of material identification is calledin different stagesfruitive activityempiric philosophy and devotional serviceup to transcendental realization. Such transcendental realization is made possible by dovetailing all the above items in relation with the Lord. Prescribed duties of the human beingas directed in the Vedascan gradually purify the sinful mind of the conditioned soul and raise him to the stage of knowledge. The purified stage of acquiring knowledge becomes the basis of devotional service to the Lord. As long as one is engaged in researching the solution of the problems of lifehis knowledge is called jñānaor purified knowledgebut on realizing the actual solution of lifeone becomes situated in the devotional service of the Lord. The Bhagavad-gītā begins with the problems of life by discriminating the soul from the elements of matter and proves by all reason and argument that the soul is indestructible in all circumstances and that the outer covering of matterthe body and the mindchange for another term of material existence which is full of miseries. The Bhagavad-gītā is therefore meant for terminating all different types of miseriesand Arjuna took shelter of this great knowledgewhich had been imparted to him during the Kurukṣetra battle."
