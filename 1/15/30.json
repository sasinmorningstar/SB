But the Supreme Lordwhen He incarnates on the earthis not influenced by kālaor the material conception of pastpresent and future. The activities of the Lord are eternaland they are manifestations of His ātma-māyāor internal potency. All pastimes or activities of the Lord are spiritual in naturebut to the laymen they appear to be on the same level with material activities. It so appeared that Arjuna and the Lord were engaged in the Battle of Kurukṣetra as the other party was also engagedbut factually the Lord was executing His mission of incarnation and association with His eternal friend Arjuna. Therefore such apparently material activities of Arjuna did not drive him away from his transcendental positionbut on the contrary revived his consciousness of the songs of the Lordas He sang them personally. This revival of consciousness is assured by the Lord in the Bhagavad-gītā  as follows:"

Because Arjuna was His confidential friendthe secret was disclosed to him."

One shouldthereforeadjust the activities of life in pace with the mission of the Lordand by doing this one is sure to return back homeback to Godhead. This is the highest perfection of life."
