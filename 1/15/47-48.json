    "translation": "\nThus by pure consciousness due to constant devotional remembrance, they attained the spiritual sky, which is ruled over by the Supreme Nārāyaṇa, Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is attained only by those who meditate upon the one Supreme Lord without deviation. This abode of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, known as Goloka Vṛndāvana, cannot be attained by persons who are absorbed in the material conception of life. But the Pāṇḍavas, being completely washed of all material contamination, attained that abode in their very same bodies.\n\n",

Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī in his Hari-bhakti-vilāsa says that a personwhatever he may becan attain the perfection of a twice-born brāhmaṇa by undergoing the spiritual disciplinary actions under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual masterexactly as a chemist can turn gun metal into gold by chemical manipulation. It is therefore the actual guidance that matters in the process of becoming a brāhmaṇaeven without change of bodyor in going back to Godhead without change of body. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī remarks that the word hi used in this connection positively affirms this truthand there is no doubt about this factual position. The Bhagavad-gītā  also affirms this statement of Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī when the Lord says that anyone who executes devotional service systematically without deviation can attain the perfection of Brahman by surpassing the contamination of the three modes of material natureand when the Brahman perfection is still more advanced by the selfsame execution of devotional servicethere is no doubt at all that one can attain the supreme spiritual planetGoloka Vṛndāvanawithout change of bodyas we have already discussed in connection with the Lord's returning to His abode without a change of body."
