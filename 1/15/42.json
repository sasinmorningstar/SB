            "text": "All that is manifested in the material world is the product of the mahat-tattva-avyaktaand things that are visible in our material vision are nothing but combinations and permutations of such variegated material products. But the living entity is different from such material products. It is due to the living entity's forgetfulness of his eternal nature as eternal servitor of the Lordand his false conception of being a so-called lord of the material naturethat he is obliged to enter into the existence of false sense enjoyment. Thus a concomitant generation of material energies is the principal cause of the mind's being materially affected. Thus the gross body of five elements is produced. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira reversed the action and merged the five elements of the body in the three modes of material nature. The qualitative distinction of the body as being goodbad or mediocre is extinguishedand again the qualitative manifestations become merged in the material energywhich is produced from a false sense of the pure living being. When one is thus inclined to become an associate of the Supreme Lordthe Personality of Godheadin one of the innumerable planets of the spiritual skyespecially in Goloka Vṛndāvanaone has to think always that he is different from the material energy; he has nothing to do with itand he has to realize himself as pure spiritBrahmanqualitatively equal with the Supreme Brahman (Parameśvara). Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhiraafter distributing his kingdom to Parīkṣit and Vajradid not think himself Emperor of the world or head of the Kuru dynasty. This sense of freedom from material relationsas well as freedom from the material encagement of the gross and subtle encirclementmakes one free to act as the servitor of the Lordeven though one is in the material world. This stage is called the jīvan-mukta stageor the liberated stageeven in the material world. That is the process of ending material existence. One must not only think that he is Brahmanbut must act like Brahman. One who only thinks himself Brahman is an impersonalist. And one who acts like Brahman is the pure devotee."
