Paramātmā is the svāṁśa part of the Lordwhereas the vibhinnāṁśa parts are the living beings. As the living being is the important factor in the material bodyfor without the living being the material body has no valuesimilarly without Paramātmā the living being has no status quo. SimilarlyBrahman or Paramātmā has no locus standi without the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is thoroughly explained in the Bhagavad-gītā. They are all interlinked with one anotheror interdependent factors; thus in the ultimate issue the Lord is the summum bonum and therefore the vital principle of everything."
