The system of four orders of life and four castes in terms of quality and workknown as varṇāśrama-dharmais the beginning of real human lifeand Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhiraas the protector of this system of human activitiestimely retired from active life as a sannyāsīhanding over the charge of the administration to a trained princeMahārāja Parīkṣit. The scientific system of varṇāśrama-dharma divides the human life into four divisions of occupation and four orders of life. The four orders of life as brahmacārīgṛhasthavānaprastha and sannyāsī are to be followed by allirrespective of the occupational division. Modern politicians do not wish to retire from active lifeeven if they are old enoughbut Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārājaas an ideal kingvoluntarily retired from active administrative life to prepare himself for the next life. Everyone's life must be so arranged that the last stage of lifesay at least the last fifteen to twenty years prior to deathcan be absolutely devoted to the devotional service of the Lord to attain the highest perfection of life. It is really foolishness to engage oneself all the days of one's life in material enjoyment and fruitive activitiesbecause as long as the mind remains absorbed in fruitive work for material enjoymentthere is no chance of getting out from conditioned lifeor material bondage. No one should follow the suicidal policy of neglecting one's supreme task of attaining the highest perfection of lifenamely going back homeback to Godhead."
