            "text": "Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira also turned his attention to the instructions of the Bhagavad-gītā after hearing about the Lord's departure from the vision of earthly people. He began to deliberate on the Lord's way of appearance and departure. The mission of the Lord's appearance and disappearance in the mortal universe is completely dependent on His supreme will. He is not forced to appear or disappear by any superior energyas the living beings appear and disappearbeing forced by the laws of nature. Whenever the Lord likesHe can appear Himself from anywhere and everywhere without disturbing His appearance and disappearance in any other place. He is like the sun. The sun appears and disappears on its own accord at any place without disturbing its presence in other places. The sun appears in the morning in India without disappearing from the Western Hemisphere. The sun is present everywhere and anywhere all over the solar systembut it so appears that in a particular place the sun appears in the morning and also disappears at some fixed time in the evening. The time limitation even of the sun is of no concernand so what to speak of the Supreme Lord who is the creator and controller of the sun. Thereforein the Bhagavad-gītā it is stated that anyone who factually understands the transcendental appearance and disappearance of the Lord by His inconceivable energy becomes liberated from the laws of birth and death and is placed in the eternal spiritual sky where the Vaikuṇṭha planets are. There such liberated persons can eternally live without the pangs of birthdeathold age and disease. In the spiritual sky the Lord and those who are eternally engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord are all eternally young because there is no old age and disease and there is no death. Because there is no death there is no birth. It is concludedthereforethat simply by understanding the Lord's appearance and disappearance in truthone can attain the perfectional stage of eternal life. ThereforeMahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira also began to consider going back to Godhead. The Lord appears on the earth or any other mortal planet along with His associates who live with Him eternallyand the members of the Yadu family who were engaged in supplementing the pastimes of the Lord are no other than His eternal associatesand so also Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and his brothers and motheretc. Since the appearance and disappearance of the Lord and His eternal associates are transcendentalone should not be bewildered by the external features of appearance and disappearance."
