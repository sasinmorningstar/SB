The impersonalists worship His glowing effulgenceemanating from His transcendental body of eternal formbliss and knowledgeand the devotees worship Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those who are below even the impersonalists consider Him to be one of the great historical personalities. The Lordhoweverdescends to attract all by His specific transcendental pastimesand thus He plays the part of the most perfect masterfriendson and lover. His transcendental relation with Arjuna was in friendshipand the Lord therefore played the part perfectlyas He did with His parentslovers and wives. While playing in such a perfect transcendental relationthe devotee forgetsby the internal potency of the Lordthat his friend or son is the Supreme Personality of Godheadalthough sometimes the devotee is bewildered by the acts of the Lord. After the departure of the LordArjuna was conscious of his great friendbut there was no mistake on the part of Arjunanor any ill estimation of the Lord. Intelligent men are attracted by the transcendental acting of the Lord with a pureunalloyed devotee like Arjuna."

Water is very rare thereand both the animals and menworking strenuously on the warfieldconstantly require water to quench their thirst. Especially wounded soldiers and generals feel very thirsty at the time of deathand it sometimes so happens that simply for want of water one has to die unavoidably. But such scarcity of water was solved in the Battle of Kurukṣetra by means of boring the ground. By God's gracewater can be easily obtained from any place if there is facility for boring the ground. The modern system works on the same principle of boring the groundbut modern engineers are still unable to dig immediately wherever necessary. It appearshoweverfrom the history as far back as the days of the Pāṇḍavasthat big generals like Arjuna could at once supply water even to the horsesand what to speak of menby drawing water from underneath the hard ground simply by penetrating the stratum with a sharp arrowa method still unknown to the modern scientists."
