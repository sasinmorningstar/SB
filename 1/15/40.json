No one can become an associate of the Lord or can go back to Godhead without such purification. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhirathereforeto become spiritually pureat once gave up his royal opulencerelinquishing his royal dress and garments. The kaṣāyaor saffron loincloth of a sannyāsīindicates freedom from all attractive material garmentsand thus he changed his dress accordingly. He became disinterested in his kingdom and family and thus became free from all material contaminationor material designation. People are generally attached to various kinds of designations—the designations of familysocietycountryoccupationwealthposition and many others. As long as one is attached to such designationshe is considered materially impure. The so-called leaders of men in the modern age are attached by national consciousnessbut they do not know that such false consciousness is also another designation of the materially conditioned soul; one has to relinquish such designations before one can become eligible to go back to Godhead. Foolish people adore such men who die in national consciousnessbut here is an example of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhiraa royal king who prepared himself to leave this world without such national consciousness. And yet he is remembered even today because he was a great pious kingalmost on the same level with the Personality of Godhead Śrī Rāma. And because people of the world were dominated by such pious kingsthey were happy in all respectsand it was quite possible for such great emperors to rule the world."
