            "text": "Draupadī was the most beautiful daughter of King Drupadaand when she was a young girl almost all the princes desired her hand. But Drupada Mahārāja decided to hand over his daughter to Arjuna only and therefore contrived a peculiar way. There was a fish hanging on the inner roof of the house under the protection of a wheel. The condition was that out of the princely orderone must be able to pierce the fish's eyes through the wheel of protectionand no one would be allowed to look up at the target. On the ground there was a waterpot in which the target and wheel were reflectedand one had to fix his aim towards the target by looking at the trembling water in the pot. Mahārāja Drupada well knew that only Arjuna or alternately Karṇa could successfully carry out the plan. But still he wanted to hand his daughter to Arjuna. And in the assembly of the princely orderwhen Dhṛṣṭadyumnathe brother of Draupadīintroduced all the princes to his grown-up sisterKarṇa was also present in the game. But Draupadī tactfully avoided Karṇa as the rival of Arjunaand she expressed her desires through her brother Dhṛṣṭadyumna that she was unable to accept anyone who was less than a kṣatriya. The vaiśyas and the śūdras are less important than the kṣatriyas. Karṇa was known as the son of a carpentera śūdra. So Draupadī avoided Karṇa by this plea. When Arjunain the dress of a poor brāhmaṇapierced the difficult targeteveryone was astonishedand all of themespecially Karṇaoffered a stiff fight to Arjunabut as usual by the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa he was able to emerge very successful in the princely fight and thus gain the valuable hand of Kṛṣṇāor Draupadī. Arjuna was lamentingly remembering the incident in the absence of the Lordby whose strength only he was so powerful."
