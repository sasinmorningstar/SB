But they do not know that behind the law of nature is the supreme direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is confirmed that the law of nature is executed under the direction of the Lord. Wheneverthereforethere is peace in the worldit must be known that it is due to the good will of the Lord. And whenever there is upheaval in the worldit is also due to the supreme will of the Lord. Not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Lord. Wheneverthereforethere is disobedience of the established rules enacted by the Lordthere is war between men and nations. The surest way to the path of peacethereforeis dovetailing everything to the established rule of the Lord. The established rule is that whatever we dowhatever we eatwhatever we sacrifice or whatever we give in charity must be done to the full satisfaction of the Lord. No one should do anythingeat anythingsacrifice anything or give anything in charity against the will of the Lord. Discretion is the better part of valorand one must learn how to discriminate between actions which may be pleasing to the Lord and those which may not be pleasing to the Lord. An action is thus judged by the Lord's pleasure or displeasure. There is no room for personal whims; we must always be guided by the pleasure of the Lord. Such action is called yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam or actions performed which are linked with the Supreme Lord. That is the art of doing a thing perfectly."
