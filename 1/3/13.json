            "text": "The society of human being is naturally divided into eight by orders and statuses of life—the four divisions of occupation and four divisions of cultural advancement. The intelligent classthe administrative classthe productive class and the laborer class are the four divisions of occupation. And the student lifethe householder's liferetired life and renounced life are the four statuses of cultural advancement towards the path of spiritual realization. Out of thesethe renounced order of lifeor the order of sannyāsais considered the highest of alland a sannyāsī is constitutionally the spiritual master for all the orders and divisions. In the sannyāsa order also there are four stages of upliftment toward perfection. These stages are called kuṭīcakabahūdakaparivrājakācāryaand paramahaṁsa. The paramahaṁsa stage of life is the highest stage of perfection. This order of life is respected by all others. Mahārāja Ṛṣabhathe son of King Nābhi and Merudevīwas an incarnation of the Lordand He instructed His sons to follow the path of perfection by tapasyawhich sanctifies one's existence and enables one to attain the stage of spiritual happiness which is eternal and ever increasing. Every living being is searching after happinessbut no one knows where eternal and unlimited happiness is obtainable. Foolish men seek after material sense pleasure as a substitute for real happinessbut such foolish men forget that temporary so-called happiness derived from sense pleasures is also enjoyed by the dogs and hogs. No animalbird or beast is bereft of this sense pleasure. In every species of lifeincluding the human form of lifesuch happiness is immensely obtainable. The human form of lifehoweveris not meant for such cheap happiness. The human life is meant for attaining eternal and unlimited happiness by spiritual realization. This spiritual realization is obtained by tapasyaor undergoing voluntarily the path of penance and abstinence from material pleasure. Those who have been trained for abstinence in material pleasures are called dhīraor men undisturbed by the senses. Only these dhīras can accept the orders of sannyāsaand they can gradually rise to the status of the paramahaṁsawhich is adored by all members of society. King Ṛṣabha propagated this missionand at the last stage He became completely aloof from the material bodily needswhich is a rare stage not to be imitated by foolish menbut to be worshiped by all."
