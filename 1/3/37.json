            "text": "No one can properly describe the transcendental nature of the Absolute Truth. Therefore it is said that He is beyond the expression of mind and speech. And yet there are some menwith a poor fund of knowledgewho desire to understand the Absolute Truth by imperfect mental speculation and faulty description of His activities. To the layman His activitiesappearance and disappearanceHis namesHis formsHis paraphernaliaHis personalities and all things in relation with Him are mysterious. There are two classes of materialistsnamely the fruitive workers and the empiric philosophers. The fruitive workers have practically no information of the Absolute Truthand the mental speculatorsafter being frustrated in fruitive activitiesturn their faces towards the Absolute Truth and try to know Him by mental speculation. And for all these menthe Absolute Truth is a mysteryas the jugglery of the magician is a mystery to children. Being deceived by the jugglery of the Supreme Beingthe nondevoteeswho may be very dexterous in fruitive work and mental speculationare always in ignorance. With such limited knowledgethey are unable to penetrate into the mysterious region of transcendence. The mental speculators are a little more progressive than the gross materialists or the fruitive workersbut because they are also within the grip of illusionthey take it for granted that anything which has forma name and activities is but a product of material energy. For them the Supreme Spirit is formlessnameless and inactive. And because such mental speculators equalize the transcendental name and form of the Lord with mundane names and formthey are in fact in ignorance. With such a poor fund of knowledgethere is no access to the real nature of the Supreme Being. As stated in Bhagavad-gītāthe Lord is always in a transcendental positioneven when He is within the material world. But ignorant men consider the Lord one of the great personalities of the worldand thus they are misled by the illusory energy."
