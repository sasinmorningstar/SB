            "text": "Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa has His eternal dhāmaor abodewhere He eternally enjoys Himself with His eternal associates and paraphernalia. And His eternal abode is a manifestation of His internal energywhereas the material world is a manifestation of His external energy. When He descends on the material worldHe displays Himself with all paraphernalia in His internal potencywhich is called ātma-māyā. In the Bhagavad-gītā the Lord says that He descends by His own potency (ātma-māyā). His formnamefameparaphernaliaabodeetc.are notthereforecreations of matter. He descends to reclaim the fallen souls and to reestablish codes of religion which are directly enacted by Him. Except for Godno one can establish the principles of religion. Either He or a suitable person empowered by Him can dictate the codes of religion. Real religion means to know Godour relation with Him and our duties in relation with Him and to know ultimately our destination after leaving this material body. The conditioned soulswho are entrapped by the material energyhardly know all these principles of life. Most of them are like animals engaged in eatingsleepingfearing and mating. They are mostly engaged in sense enjoyment under the pretension of religiosityknowledge or salvation. They are still more blind in the present age of quarrelor Kali-yuga. In the Kali-yuga the population is just a royal edition of the animals. They have nothing to do with spiritual knowledge or godly religious life. They are so blind that they cannot see anything beyond the jurisdiction of the subtle mindintelligence or egobut they are very much proud of their advancement in knowledgescience and material prosperity. They can risk their lives to become a dog or hog just after leaving the present bodyfor they have completely lost sight of the ultimate aim of life. The Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared before us just a little prior to the beginning of Kali-yugaand He returned to His eternal home practically at the commencement of Kali-yuga. While He was presentHe exhibited everything by His different activities. He spoke the Bhagavad-gītā specifically and eradicated all pretentious principles of religiosity. And prior to His departure from this material worldHe empowered Śrī Vyāsadeva through Nārada to compile the messages of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamand thus both the Bhagavad-gītā and the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam are like torchbearers for the blind people of this age. In other wordsif men in this age of Kali want to see the real light of lifethey must take to these two books onlyand their aim of life will be fulfilled. Bhagavad-gītā is the preliminary study of the Bhāgavatam. And Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is the summum bonum of lifeLord Śrī Kṛṣṇa personified. We must therefore accept Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam as the direct representation of Lord Kṛṣṇa. One who can see Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam can see also Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa in person. They are identical."
