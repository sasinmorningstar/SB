The intelligent class of men (namely the sages and the brāhmaṇas) not only prayed for the Lord to come downbut also dethroned the previous king. It is the duty of the king to be pious and thus look after the all-around welfare of the citizens. Whenever there is some negligence on the part of the king in discharging his dutythe intelligent class of men must dethrone him. The intelligent class of menhoweverdo not occupy the royal thronebecause they have much more important duties for the welfare of the public. Instead of occupying the royal thronethey prayed for the incarnation of the Lordand the Lord came as Mahārāja Pṛthu. Real intelligent menor qualified brāhmaṇasnever aspire for political posts. Mahārāja Pṛthu excavated many produces from the earthand thus not only did the citizens become happy to have such a good kingbut the complete sight of the earth also became beautiful and attractive."
