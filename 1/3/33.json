The coverings take place due to ignorance. Such coverings are never effective in the person of the Personality of Godhead. Knowing this convincingly is called liberationor seeing the Absolute. This means that perfect self-realization is made possible by adoption of godly or spiritual life. Self-realization means becoming indifferent to the needs of the gross and subtle bodies and becoming serious about the activities of the self. The impetus for activities is generated from the selfbut such activities become illusory due to ignorance of the real position of the self. By ignoranceself-interest is calculated in terms of the gross and subtle bodiesand therefore a whole set of activities is spoiledlife after life. Whenhoweverone meets the self by proper culturethe activities of the self begin. Therefore a man who is engaged in the activities of the self is called jīvan-muktaor a liberated person even in the conditional existence."

In the Bhagavad-gītā the Lord says that He is present in everyone's heartand from Him only all knowledgeremembrance or forgetfulness take place. When the living being desires to be an enjoyer of material energy (illusory phenomena)the Lord covers the living being in the mystery of forgetfulnessand thus the living being misinterprets the gross body and subtle mind to be his own self. And by culture of transcendental knowledgewhen the living being prays to the Lord for deliverance from the clutches of forgetfulnessthe Lordby His causeless mercyremoves the living being's illusory curtainand thus he realizes his own self. He then engages himself in the service of the Lord in his eternal constitutional positionbecoming liberated from the conditioned life. All this is executed by the Lord either through His external potency or directly by the internal potency."
