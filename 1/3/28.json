            "text": "In this particular stanza Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇathe Personality of Godheadis distinguished from other incarnations. He is counted amongst the avatāras (incarnations) because out of His causeless mercy the Lord descends from His transcendental abode. Avatāra means \"one who descends.\" All the incarnations of the Lordincluding the Lord Himselfdescend on the different planets of the material world as also in different species of life to fulfill particular missions. Sometimes He comes Himselfand sometimes His different plenary portions or parts of the plenary portionsor His differentiated portions directly or indirectly empowered by Himdescend on this material world to execute certain specific functions. Originally the Lord is full of all opulencesall prowessall fameall beautyall knowledge and all renunciation. When they are partly manifested through the plenary portions or parts of the plenary portionsit should be noted that certain manifestations of His different powers are required for those particular functions. When in the room small electric bulbs are displayedit does not mean that the electric powerhouse is limited by the small bulbs. The same powerhouse can supply power to operate large-scale industrial dynamos with greater volts. Similarlythe incarnations of the Lord display limited powers because so much power is needed at that particular time."

            "text": "For exampleLord Paraśurāma and Lord Nṛsiṁha displayed unusual opulence by killing the disobedient kṣatriyas twenty-one times and killing the greatly powerful atheist Hiraṇyakaśipu. Hiraṇyakaśipu was so powerful that even the demigods in other planets would tremble simply by the unfavorable raising of his eyebrow. The demigods in the higher level of material existence manymany times excel the most well-to-do human beingsin duration of lifebeautywealthparaphernaliaand in all other respects. Still they were afraid of Hiraṇyakaśipu. Thus we can simply imagine how powerful Hiraṇyakaśipu was in this material world. But even Hiraṇyakaśipu was cut into small pieces by the nails of Lord Nṛsiṁha. This means that anyone materially powerful cannot stand the strength of the Lord's nails. SimilarlyJāmadagnya displayed the Lord's power to kill all the disobedient kings powerfully situated in their respective states. The Lord's empowered incarnation Nārada and plenary incarnation Varāhaas well as indirectly empowered Lord Buddhacreated faith in the mass of people. The incarnations of Rāma and Dhanvantari displayed His fameand BalarāmaMohinī and Vāmana exhibited His beauty. DattātreyaMatsyaKumāra and Kapila exhibited His transcendental knowledge. Nara and Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣis exhibited His renunciation. So all the different incarnations of the Lord indirectly or directly manifested different featuresbut Lord Kṛṣṇathe primeval Lordexhibited the complete features of Godheadand thus it is confirmed that He is the source of all other incarnations. And the most extraordinary feature exhibited by Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was His internal energetic manifestation of His pastimes with the cowherd girls. His pastimes with the gopīs are all displays of transcendental existencebliss and knowledgealthough these are manifested apparently as sex love. The specific attraction of His pastimes with the gopīs should never be misunderstood. The Bhāgavatam relates these transcendental pastimes in the Tenth Canto. And in order to reach the position to understand the transcendental nature of Lord Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with the gopīsthe Bhāgavatam promotes the student gradually in nine other cantos."

It is not that Lord Kṛṣṇa has any source of incarnation. All the symptoms of the Supreme Truth in full are present in the person of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇaand in the Bhagavad-gītā the Lord emphatically declares that there is no truth greater than or equal to Himself. In this stanza the word svayam is particularly mentioned to confirm that Lord Kṛṣṇa has no other source than Himself. Although in other places the incarnations are described as bhagavān because of their specific functionsnowhere are they declared to be the Supreme Personality. In this stanza the word svayam signifies the supremacy as the summum bonum."

He Himself has expanded Himself in various partsportions and particles as svayaṁ-rūpasvayam-prakāśatad-ekātmāprābhavavaibhavavilāsaavatāraāveśaand jīvasall provided with innumerable energies just suitable to the respective persons and personalities. Learned scholars in transcendental subjects have carefully analyzed the summum bonum Kṛṣṇa to have sixty-four principal attributes. All the expansions or categories of the Lord possess only some percentages of these attributes. But Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the possessor of the attributes cent percent. And His personal expansions such as svayam-prakāśatad-ekātmā up to the categories of the avatāras who are all viṣṇu-tattvapossess up to ninety-three percent of these transcendental attributes. Lord Śivawho is neither avatāra nor āveśa nor in between thempossesses almost eighty-four percent of the attributes. But the jīvasor the individual living beings in different statuses of lifepossess up to the limit of seventy-eight percent of the attributes. In the conditioned state of material existencethe living being possesses these attributes in very minute quantityvarying in terms of the pious life of the living being. The most perfect of living beings is Brahmāthe supreme administrator of one universe. He possesses seventy-eight percent of the attributes in full. All other demigods have the same attributes in less quantitywhereas human beings possess the attributes in very minute quantity. The standard of perfection for a human being is to develop the attributes up to seventy-eight percent in full. The living being can never possess attributes like ŚivaViṣṇu or Lord Kṛṣṇa. A living being can become godly by developing the seventy-eight-percent transcendental attributes in fullnessbut he can never become a God like ŚivaViṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa. He can become a Brahmā in due course. The godly living beings who are all residents of the planets in the spiritual sky are eternal associates of God in different spiritual planets called Hari-dhāma and Maheśa-dhāma. The abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa above all spiritual planets is called Kṛṣṇaloka or Goloka Vṛndāvanaand the perfected living beingby developing seventy-eight percent of the above attributes in fullnesscan enter the planet of Kṛṣṇaloka after leaving the present material body."
