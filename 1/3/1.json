So this puruṣa form is the confirmation of the same principle. The original Personality of Godhead Vāsudevaor Lord Kṛṣṇawho is famous as the son of King Vasudeva or King Nandais full with all opulencesall potenciesall fameall beautyall knowledge and all renunciation. Part of His opulences are manifested as impersonal Brahmanand part of His opulences are manifested as Paramātmā. This puruṣa feature of the same Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Paramātmā manifestation of the Lord. There are three puruṣa features in the material creationand this formwho is known as the Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇuis the first of the three. The others are known as the Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and the Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇuwhich we shall know one after another. The innumerable universes are generated from the skin holes of this Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇuand in each one of the universes the Lord enters as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu."

            "text": "In the Bhagavad-gītā it is also mentioned that the material world is created at certain intervals and then again destroyed. This creation and destruction is done by the supreme will because of the conditioned soulsor the nitya-baddha living beings. The nitya-baddhaor the eternally conditioned soulshave the sense of individuality or ahaṅkārawhich dictates them sense enjoymentwhich they are unable to have constitutionally. The Lord is the only enjoyerand all others are enjoyed. The living beings are predominated enjoyers. But the eternally conditioned soulsforgetful of this constitutional positionhave strong aspirations to enjoy. The chance to enjoy matter is given to the conditioned souls in the material worldand side by side they are given the chance to understand their real constitutional position. Those fortunate living entities who catch the truth and surrender unto the lotus feet of Vāsudeva after manymany births in the material world join the eternally liberated souls and thus are allowed to enter into the kingdom of Godhead. After thissuch fortunate living entities need not come again within the occasional material creation. But those who cannot catch the constitutional truth are again merged into the mahat-tattva at the time of the annihilation of the material creation. When the creation is again set upthis mahat-tattva is again let loose. This mahat-tattva contains all the ingredients of the material manifestationsincluding the conditioned souls. Primarily this mahat-tattva is divided into sixteen partsnamely the five gross material elements and the eleven working instruments or senses. It is like the cloud in the clear sky. In the spiritual skythe effulgence of Brahman is spread all aroundand the whole system is dazzling in spiritual light. The mahat-tattva is assembled in some corner of the vastunlimited spiritual skyand the part which is thus covered by the mahat-tattva is called the material sky. This part of the spiritual skycalled the mahat-tattvais only an insignificant portion of the whole spiritual skyand within this mahat-tattva there are innumerable universes. All these universes are collectively produced by the Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇucalled also the Mahā-Viṣṇuwho simply throws His glance to impregnate the material sky."
