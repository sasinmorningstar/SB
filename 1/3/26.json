There are many otherssuch as Śrī HayagrīvaHariHaṁsaPṛśnigarbhaVibhuSatyasenaVaikuṇṭhaSārvabhaumaViṣvaksenaDharmasetuSudhāmāYogeśvaraBṛhadbhānu and others of the bygone ages. Śrī Prahlāda Mahārāja said in his prayer\"My LordYou manifest as many incarnations as there are species of lifenamely the aquaticsthe vegetablesthe reptilesthe birdsthe beaststhe menthe demigodsetc.just for the maintenance of the faithful and the annihilation of the unfaithful. You advent Yourself in this way in accordance with the necessity of the different yugas. In the Kali-yuga You have incarnated garbed as a devotee.\" This incarnation of the Lord in the Kali-yuga is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. There are many other placesboth in the Bhāgavatam and in other scripturesin which the incarnation of the Lord as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is explicitly mentioned. In the Brahma-saṁhitā also it is said indirectly that although there are many incarnations of the Lordsuch as RāmaNṛsiṁhaVarāhaMatsyaKūrma and many othersthe Lord Himself sometimes incarnates in person. Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are notthereforeincarnationsbut the original source of all other incarnations. This will be clearly explained in the next śloka. So the Lord is the inexhaustible source for innumerable incarnations which are not always mentioned. But such incarnations are distinguished by specific extraordinary feats which are impossible to be performed by any living being. That is the general test to identify an incarnation of the Lorddirectly and indirectly empowered. Some incarnations mentioned above are almost plenary portions. For instancethe Kumāras are empowered with transcendental knowledge. Śrī Nārada is empowered with devotional service. Mahārāja Pṛthu is an empowered incarnation with executive function. The Matsya incarnation is directly a plenary portion. So the innumerable incarnations of the Lord are manifested all over the universes constantlywithout cessationas water flows constantly from waterfalls."
