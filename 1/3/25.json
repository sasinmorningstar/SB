He is to appear at the conjunction of the two yugasnamely at the end of Kali-yuga and the beginning of Satya-yuga. The cycle of the four yugasnamely SatyaTretāDvāpara and Kalirotates like the calendar months. The present Kali-yuga lasts 432,000 yearsout of which we have passed only 5,000 years after the Battle of Kurukṣetra and the end of the regime of King Parīkṣit. So there are 427,000 years balance yet to be finished. Therefore at the end of this periodthe incarnation of Kalki will take placeas foretold in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. The name of His fatherViṣṇu Yaśāa learned brāhmaṇaand the village Śambhala are also mentioned. As above mentionedall these foretellings will prove to be factual in chronological order. That is the authority of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam."
