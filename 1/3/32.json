But in fact all these gross or subtle conceptions of the body are in relation with the living beings. The living being has his spiritual form beyond this gross material or subtle psychic existence. The gross body and psychic functions cease to act as soon as the living being leaves the visible gross body. In factwe say that the living being has gone away because he is unseen and unheard. Even when the gross body is not acting when the living being is in sound sleepwe know that he is within the body by his breathing. So the living being's passing away from the body does not mean that there is no existence of the living soul. It is thereotherwise how can he repeat his births again and again?"

All such conceptions of God's body are imaginary. The living being has his eternal spiritual formwhich is conditioned only by his material contamination."
