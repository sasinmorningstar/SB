            "text": "All the above statements by the Lord apply to different plenary portions of the Lordnamely His expansions such as SaṅkarṣaṇaVāsudevaPradyumnaAniruddha and Nārāyaṇa. These are all He Himself in different transcendental expansionsand still the Lord as Śrī Kṛṣṇa functions in a different sphere of transcendental exchange with different grades of devotees. And yet Lord Kṛṣṇa as He is appears once every twenty-four hours of Brahmā's time (or after a lapse of 8,640,000,000 solar years) in each and every universeand all His transcendental pastimes are displayed in each and every universe in a routine spool. But in that routine spool the functions of Lord KṛṣṇaLord Vāsudevaetc.are complex problems for the layman. There is no difference between the Lord's Self and the Lord's transcendental body. The expansions execute differential activities. When the Lordhoweverappears in His person as Lord Śrī KṛṣṇaHis other plenary portions also join in Him by His inconceivable potency called yogamāyāand thus the Lord Kṛṣṇa of Vṛndāvana is different from the Lord Kṛṣṇa of Mathurā or the Lord Kṛṣṇa of Dvārakā. The virāṭ-rūpa of Lord Kṛṣṇa is also different from Himby His inconceivable potency. The virāṭ-rūpa exhibited on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra is the material conception of His form. Therefore it should be understood that when Lord Kṛṣṇa was apparently killed by the bow and arrow of the hunterthe Lord left His so-called material body in the material world. The Lord is kaivalyaand for Him there is no difference between matter and spirit because everything is created from Him. Therefore His quitting one sort of body or accepting another body does not mean that He is like the ordinary living being. All such activities are simultaneously one and different by His inconceivable potency. When Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was lamenting the possibility of His disappearanceit was just in pursuance of a custom of lamenting the disappearance of a great friendbut factually the Lord never quits His transcendental bodyas is misconceived by less intelligent persons. Such less intelligent persons have been condemned by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gītāand they are known as the mūḍhas. That the Lord left His body means that He left again His plenary portions in the respective dhāmas (transcendental abodes)as He left His virāṭ-rūpa in the material world."
