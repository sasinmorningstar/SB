He went to Indraloka also with Satyabhāmāand she was received by Śacīdevīwho introduced her to the mother of the demigodsAditi. Aditi was very much pleased with Satyabhāmāand she blessed her with the benediction of permanent youth as long as Lord Kṛṣṇa remained on the earth. Aditi also took her with her to show her the special prerogatives of the demigods in the heavenly planets. When Satyabhāmā saw the pārijāta flowershe desired to have it in her palace at Dvārakā. After thatshe came back to Dvārakā along with her husband and expressed her willingness to have the pārijāta flower at her palace. Satyabhāmā's palace was especially bedecked with valuable jewelsand even in the hottest season of summer the inside of the palace remained coolas if air-conditioned. She decorated her palace with various flagsheralding the news of her great husband's presence there. Oncealong with her husbandshe met Draupadīand she was anxious to be instructed by Draupadī in the ways and means of pleasing her husband. Draupadī was expert in this affair because she kept five husbandsthe Pāṇḍavasand all were very much pleased with her. On receipt of Draupadī's instructionsshe was very much pleased and offered her good wishes and returned to Dvārakā. She was the daughter of Satrājit. After the departure of Lord Kṛṣṇawhen Arjuna visited Dvārakāall the queensincluding Satyabhāmā and Rukmiṇīlamented for the Lord with great feeling.

As already explainedthe Lord had very little to do with so many wives to carry out their orders like an ordinary man. But because the queens accepted the high quality of devotional servicenamely administering the Lord all comfortsthe Lord played the part of a faithful and complete husband. No earthly creature can expect to have things from the heavenly kingdomespecially the pārijāta flowerswhich are simply to be used by the demigods. But due to their becoming the Lord's faithful wivesall of them enjoyed the special prerogatives of the great wives of the denizens of heaven. In other wordssince the Lord is the proprietor of everything within His creationit is not very astonishing for the queens of Dvārakā to have any rare thing from any part of the universe."
