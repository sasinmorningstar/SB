            "text": "Here in this particular verse the Lord is described as bhagavāngovindabrahmaṇya and bhakta-vatsala. He is bhagavān svayamor the original Supreme Personality of Godheadfull with all opulencesall powerall knowledgeall beautyall fame and all renunciation. No one is equal to or greater than Him. He is Govinda because He is the pleasure of the cows and the senses. Those who have purified their senses by the devotional service of the Lord can render unto Him real service and thereby derive transcendental pleasure out of such purified senses. Only the impure conditioned living being cannot derive any pleasure from the sensesbut being illusioned by false pleasures of the senseshe becomes servant of the senses. Thereforewe need His protection for our own interest. The Lord is the protector of cows and the brahminical culture. A society devoid of cow protection and brahminical culture is not under the direct protection of the Lordjust as the prisoners in the jails are not under the protection of the king but under the protection of a severe agent of the king. Without cow protection and cultivation of the brahminical qualities in human societyat least for a section of the members of societyno human civilization can prosper at any length. By brahminical culturethe development of the dormant qualities of goodnessnamely truthfulnessequanimitysense controlforbearancesimplicitygeneral knowledgetranscendental knowledgeand firm faith in the Vedic wisdomone can become a brāhmaṇa and thus see the Lord as He is. And after surpassing the brahminical perfectionone has to become a devotee of the Lord so that His loving affection in the form of proprietormasterfriendson and lover can be transcendentally achieved. The stage of a devoteewhich attracts the transcendental affection of the Lorddoes not develop unless one has developed the qualities of a brāhmaṇa as above mentioned. The Lord is inclined to a brāhmaṇa of quality and not of false prestige. Those who are less than a brāhmaṇa by qualification cannot establish any relation with the Lordjust as fire cannot be kindled from the raw earth unless there is woodalthough there is a relation between wood and the earth. Since the Lord is all-perfect in Himselfthere could not be any question of His welfareand Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira refrained from asking this question. He simply inquired about His residential placeDvārakā Purīwhere pious men assemble. The Lord stays only where pious men assemble and takes pleasure in their glorifying the Supreme Truth. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was anxious to know about the pious men and their pious acts in the city of Dvārakā."
