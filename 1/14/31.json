            "text": "As already mentionedLord Kṛṣṇa married 16,108 wivesand each of them had ten sons. Therefore 16,108 x 10 161,080 sons. They all grew upand each of them had as many sons as their fatherand the whole aggregate was something near 1,610,800 family members of the Lord. The Lord is the father of all living beingswho are countless in number; therefore only a few of them are called to associate with the Lord in His transcendental pastimes as the Lord of Dvārakā on this earth. It is not astonishing that the Lord maintained a visible family consisting of so many members. It is better to refrain from comparing the Lord's position to oursand it becomes a simple truth as soon as we understand at least a partial calculation of the Lord's transcendental position. King Yudhiṣṭhirawhile inquiring about the Lord's sons and grandsons at Dvārakāmentioned only the chieftains amongst themfor it was impossible for him to remember all the names of the Lord's family members."
