Millions and billions of suns are created by Him and annihilated by Him within His one breathing period. In the material world the sun is considered to be the source of all productivity and material energyand only due to the sun can we have the necessities of life. Thereforeduring the personal presence of the Lord on the earthall paraphernalia for our peace and prosperityespecially religion and knowledgewere in full display because of the Lord's presencejust as there is a full flood of light in the presence of the glowing sun. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira observed some discrepancies in his kingdomand therefore he became very anxious about Arjunawho was long absentand there was also no news about Dvārakā's well-being. He suspected the disappearance of Lord Kṛṣṇaotherwise there would have been no possibility of fearful omens."
