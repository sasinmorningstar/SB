            "text": "A conditioned living being is endowed with four principles of malpracticenamely errorsinsanityinability and cheating. These are signs of imperfectionand out of the four the propensity to cheat others is most prominent. And this cheating practice is there in the conditioned souls because the conditioned souls are primarily in the material world imbued with an unnatural desire to lord it over the material world. A living being in his pure state is not conditioned by the laws because in his pure state he is conscious that a living being is eternally subservient to the Supreme Beingand thus it is always good for him to remain subservientinstead of falsely trying to lord it over the property of the Supreme Lord. In the conditioned state the living being is not satisfied even if he actually becomes the lord of all that he surveyswhich he never becomesand therefore he becomes the victim of all kinds of cheatingeven with his nearest and most intimate relations. In such an unsatisfactory state of affairsthere is no harmonyeven between father and sons or between husband and wife. But all these contending difficulties can be mitigated by one processand that is the devotional service of the Lord. The world of hypocrisy can be checked only by counteraction through devotional service to the Lord and nothing else. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhirahaving observed the disparitiesconjectured the disappearance of the Lord from the earth."
