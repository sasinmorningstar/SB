            "text": "Material prosperity consists of a good wifegood homesufficient landgood childrenaristocratic family relationsvictory over competitors andby pious workattainment of accommodations in the higher celestial planets for better facilities of material amenities. These facilities are earned not only by one's hard manual labor or by unfair meansbut by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Prosperity earned by one's personal endeavor also depends on the mercy of the Lord. Personal labor must be there in addition to the Lord's benedictionbut without the Lord's benediction no one is successful simply by personal labor. The modernized man of Kali-yuga believes in personal endeavor and denies the benediction of the Supreme Lord. Even a great sannyāsī of India delivered speeches in Chicago protesting the benedictions of the Supreme Lord. But as far as Vedic śāstras are concernedas we find in the pages of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamthe ultimate sanction for all success rests in the hands of the Supreme Lord. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira admits this truth in his personal successand it behooves one to follow in the footsteps of a great king and devotee of the Lord to make life a full success. If one could achieve success without the sanction of the Lord then no medical practitioner would fail to cure a patient. Despite the most advanced treatment of a suffering patient by the most up-to-date medical practitionerthere is deathand even in the most hopeless casewithout medical treatmenta patient is cured astonishingly. Therefore the conclusion is that God's sanction is the immediate cause for all happeningsgood or bad. Any successful man should feel grateful to the Lord for all he has achieved."
