Similarlythe children of the statethe cowthe diseased personthe woman and the old man specifically require the protection of the state or a kṣatriya king. If such living beings do not get protection by the kṣatriyaor the royal orderor by the stateit is certainly shameful for the kṣatriya or the state. If such things had actually happened to ArjunaMahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was anxious to know about these discrepancies."
