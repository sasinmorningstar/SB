Things we do not want are forced upon us by some superior energyand we do not see that these undesirables are under the grip of the three modes of material nature. When a man's eyesarms and thighs all quiver constantlyone must know that something is going to happen which is undesirable. These undesirables are compared to fire in a forest. No one goes into the forest to set firesbut fires automatically take place in the forestcreating inconceivable calamities for the living beings of the forest. Such a fire cannot be extinguished by any human efforts. The fire can be extinguished only by the mercy of the Lordwho sends clouds to pour water on the forest. Similarlyundesirable happenings in life cannot be checked by any number of plans. Such miseries can be removed only by the mercy of the Lordwho sends His bona fide representatives to enlighten human beings and thus save them from all calamities."
