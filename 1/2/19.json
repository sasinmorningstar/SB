This state of existence is called brahma-bhūta  or ātmā-nandīor the state of self-satisfaction. This self-satisfaction is not like the satisfaction of the inactive fool. The inactive fool is in the state of foolish ignorancewhereas the self-satisfied ātmānandī is transcendental to the material state of existence. This stage of perfection is attained as soon as one is fixed in irrevocable devotional service. Devotional service is not inactivitybut the unalloyed activity of the soul."

The effect of devotional service becomes manifest by complete elimination of these effects of passion and ignorance. The devotee is fixed at once in the mode of goodnessand he makes further progress to rise to the position of Vāsudevaor the state of unmixed sattvaor śuddha-sattva. Only in this śuddha-sattva state can one always see Kṛṣṇa eye to eye by dint of pure affection for the Lord."

A devotee is always qualified with all the good qualities of God. Quantitatively such qualifications may be differentbut qualitatively both the Lord and His devotee are one and the same."
