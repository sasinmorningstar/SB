The four castes are the intelligent castethe martial castethe productive caste and the laborer caste. These castes are classified in terms of one's work and qualification and not by birth. Then again there are four orders of lifenamely the student lifethe householder's lifethe retired and the devotional life. In the best interest of human society there must be such divisions of lifeotherwise no social institution can grow in a healthy state. And in each and every one of the abovementioned divisions of lifethe aim must be to please the supreme authority of the Personality of Godhead. This institutional function of human society is known as the system of varṇāśrama-dharmawhich is quite natural for the civilized life. The varṇāśrama institution is constructed to enable one to realize the Absolute Truth. It is not for artificial domination of one division over another. When the aim of lifei.e.realization of the Absolute Truthis missed by too much attachment for indriya-prītior sense gratificationas already discussed hereinbeforethe institution of the varṇāśrama is utilized by selfish men to pose an artificial predominance over the weaker section. In the Kali-yugaor in the age of quarrelthis artificial predominance is already currentbut the saner section of the people know it well that the divisions of castes and orders of life are meant for smooth social intercourse and high-thinking self-realization and not for any other purpose."
