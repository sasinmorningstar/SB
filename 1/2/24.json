    "translation": "\nFirewood is a transformation of earth, but smoke is better than the raw wood. And fire is still better, for by fire we can derive the benefits of superior knowledge [through Vedic sacrifices]. Similarly, passion [rajas] is better than ignorance [tamas], but goodness [sattva] is best because by goodness one can come to realize the Absolute Truth.\n\n",

It is further comprehended herein that one has to rise to the platform of the mode of goodness (sattva) so that one can be eligible for the devotional service of the Lord. But if there are impediments on the progressive pathanyoneeven from the platform of tamascan gradually rise to the sattva platform by the expert direction of the spiritual master. Sincere candidates mustthereforeapproach an expert spiritual master for such a progressive marchand the bona fideexpert spiritual master is competent to direct a disciple from any stage of life: tamasrajas or sattva."

The civilized life of manwith a passion for various types of material benefitsis the stage of rajas. The rajas stage of life gives a slight clue to the realization of the Absolute Truth in the forms of fine sentiments in philosophyart and culture with moral and ethical principlesbut the mode of sattva is a still higher stage of material qualitywhich actually helps one in realizing the Absolute Truth. In other wordsthere is a qualitative difference between the different kinds of worshiping methods as well as the respective results derived from the predominating deitiesnamely BrahmāViṣṇu and Hara."
