The ultimate aim of religious performances is to release oneself from material bondage and regain the life of freedom in the transcendental worldwhere the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Person. Laws of religionthereforeare directly enacted by the Personality of Godheadand except for the mahājanasor the authorized agents of the Lordno one knows the purpose of religion. There are twelve particular agents of the Lord who know the purpose of religionand all of them render transcendental service unto Him. Persons who desire their own good may follow these mahājanas and thus attain the supreme benefit."
