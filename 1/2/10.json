            "text": "The completely bewildered material civilization is wrongly directed towards the fulfillment of desires in sense gratification. In such civilizationin all spheres of lifethe ultimate end is sense gratification. In politicssocial servicealtruismphilanthropy and ultimately in religion or even in salvationthe very same tint of sense gratification is ever-increasingly predominant. In the political field the leaders of men fight with one another to fulfill their personal sense gratification. The voters adore the so-called leaders only when they promise sense gratification. As soon as the voters are dissatisfied in their own sense satisfactionthey dethrone the leadersThe leaders must always disappoint the voters by not satisfying their senses. The same is applicable in all other fields; no one is serious about the problems of life. Even those who are on the path of salvation desire to become one with the Absolute Truth and desire to commit spiritual suicide for sense gratification. But the Bhāgavatam says that one should not live for sense gratification. One should satisfy the senses only insomuch as required for self-preservationand not for sense gratification. Because the body is made of senseswhich also require a certain amount of satisfactionthere are regulative directions for satisfaction of such senses. But the senses are not meant for unrestricted enjoyment. For examplemarriage or the combination of a man with a woman is necessary for progenybut it is not meant for sense enjoyment. In the absence of voluntary restraintthere is propaganda for family planningbut foolish men do not know that family planning is automatically executed as soon as there is search after the Absolute Truth. Seekers of the Absolute Truth are never allured by unnecessary engagements in sense gratification because the serious students seeking the Absolute Truth are always overwhelmed with the work of researching the Truth. In every sphere of lifethereforethe ultimate end must be seeking after the Absolute Truthand that sort of engagement will make one happy because he will be less engaged in varieties of sense gratification. And what that Absolute Truth is is explained as follows."
