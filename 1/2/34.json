The Lord (Viṣṇu) incarnates Himself in each and every one of them and in each and every type of living society. He manifests His transcendental pastimes amongst them just to create the desire to go back to Godhead. The Lord does not change His original transcendental positionbut He appears to be differently manifested according to the particular timecircumstances and society."

The happiness which the living beings are hankering for is not to be found within any corner of the innumerable universes and material planets. The eternal happiness which the living being wants is obtainable in the kingdom of Godbut the forgetful living beings under the influence of the material modes have no information of the kingdom of God. The Lordthereforecomes to propagate the message of the kingdom of Godeither personally as an incarnation or through His bona fide representative as the good son of God. Such incarnations or sons of God are not making propaganda for going back to Godhead only within the human society. Their work is also going on in all types of societiesamongst demigods and those other than human beings."
