According to thembhaktior the devotional service of the Lordis meant for those who cannot perform the high-grade activities. Generally it is said that the bhakti cult is meant for the śūdrasvaiśyas and the less intelligent woman class. But that is not the actual fact. The bhakti cult is the topmost of all transcendental activitiesand therefore it is simultaneously sublime and easy. It is sublime for the pure devotees who are serious about getting in contact with the Supreme Lordand it is easy for the neophytes who are just on the threshold of the house of bhakti. To achieve the contact of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa is a great scienceand it is open for all living beingsincluding the śūdrasvaiśyaswomen and even those lower than the lowborn śūdrasso what to speak of the high-class men like the qualified brāhmaṇas and the great self-realized kings. The other high-grade activities designated as sacrificecharityausterityetc.are all corollary factors following the pure and scientific bhakti cult."

            "text": "The principles of knowledge and detachment are two important factors on the path of transcendental realization. The whole spiritual process leads to perfect knowledge of everything material and spiritualand the results of such perfect knowledge are that one becomes detached from material affection and becomes attached to spiritual activities. Becoming detached from material things does not mean becoming inert altogetheras men with a poor fund of knowledge think. Naiṣkarma means not undertaking activities that will produce good or bad effects. Negation does not mean negation of the positive. Negation of the nonessentials does not mean negation of the essential. Similarlydetachment from material forms does not mean nullifying the positive form. The bhakti cult is meant for realization of the positive form. When the positive form is realizedthe negative forms are automatically eliminated. Thereforewith the development of the bhakti cultwith the application of positive service to the positive formone naturally becomes detached from inferior thingsand he becomes attached to superior things. Similarlythe bhakti cultbeing the supermost occupation of the living beingleads him out of material sense enjoyment. That is the sign of a pure devotee. He is not a foolnor is he engaged in the inferior energiesnor does he have material values. This is not possible by dry reasoning. It actually happens by the grace of the Almighty. In conclusionone who is a pure devotee has all other good qualitiesnamely knowledgedetachmentetc.but one who has only knowledge or detachment is not necessarily well acquainted with the principles of the bhakti cult. Bhakti is the supermost occupation of the human being."
