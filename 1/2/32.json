Matterantimatterprotonneutronetc.are all different effects of the Paramātmā feature of the Lord. As from woodfire can be manifestedor as butter can be churned out of milkso also the presence of the Lord as Paramātmā can be felt by the process of legitimate hearing and chanting of the transcendental subjects which are especially treated in the Vedic literatures like the Upaniṣads and Vedānta. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is the bona fide explanation of these Vedic literatures. The Lord can be realized through the aural reception of the transcendental messageand that is the only way to experience the transcendental subject. As fire is kindled from wood by another firethe divine consciousness of man can similarly be kindled by another divine grace. His Divine Grace the spiritual master can kindle the spiritual fire from the woodlike living entity by imparting proper spiritual messages injected through the receptive ear. Therefore one is required to approach the proper spiritual master with receptive ears onlyand thus divine existence is gradually realized. The difference between animality and humanity lies in this process only. A human being can hear properlywhereas an animal cannot."
