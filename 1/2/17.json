Wheneverthereforeoffenseless hearing and glorification of God are undertakenit is to be understood that Lord Kṛṣṇa is present there in the form of transcendental soundwhich is as powerful as the Lord personally. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhuin His Śikṣāṣṭakadeclares clearly that the holy name of the Lord has all the potencies of the Lord and that He has endowed His innumerable names with the same potency. There is no rigid fixture of timeand anyone can chant the holy name with attention and reverence at his convenience. The Lord is so kind to us that He can be present before us personally in the form of transcendental soundbut unfortunately we have no taste for hearing and glorifying the Lord's name and activities. We have already discussed developing a taste for hearing and chanting the holy sound. It is done through the medium of service to the pure devotee of the Lord."

When He sees that a devotee is completely sincere in getting admittance to the transcendental service of the Lord and has thus become eager to hear about Himthe Lord acts from within the devotee in such a way that the devotee may easily go back to Him. The Lord is more anxious to take us back into His kingdom than we can desire. Most of us do not desire at all to go back to Godhead. Only a very few men want to go back to Godhead. But anyone who desires to go back to GodheadŚrī Kṛṣṇa helps in all respects."

It is very difficult to get rid of such desires. Women and wealth are very difficult problems for the devotee making progress on the path back to Godhead. Many stalwarts in the devotional line fell victim to these allurements and thus retreated from the path of liberation. But when one is helped by the Lord Himselfthe whole process becomes as easy as anything by the divine grace of the Lord."

By the grace of God such a devotee gets sufficient strength to defend himself from the state of disturbancesand gradually all disturbing elements are eliminated from his mind."
