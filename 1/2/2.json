When he went away to take up the renounced order of life [sannyāsa], leaving home without undergoing reformation by the sacred thread or the ceremonies observed by the higher castes, his father, Vyāsadeva, fearing separation from him, cried out, \"O my son!\" Indeed, only the trees, which were absorbed in the same feelings of separation, echoed in response to the begrieved father.\n\n",

Such duties enjoin that a candidate willing to study the Vedas must approach a bona fide spiritual master and request acceptance as his disciple. The sacred thread is the sign of those who are competent to study the Vedas from the ācāryaor the bona fide spiritual master. Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī did not undergo such purificatory ceremonies because he was a liberated soul from his very birth."

When he sees a new light and seeks direction for spiritual progresshe approaches a spiritual master for instruction in the Vedas. The spiritual master accepts only the sincere inquirer as his disciple and gives him the sacred thread. In this way a man becomes twice-bornor a dvija. After qualifying as a dvija one may study the Vedasand after becoming well versed in the Vedas one becomes a vipra. A vipraor a qualified brāhmaṇathus realizes the Absolute and makes further progress in spiritual life until he reaches the Vaiṣṇava stage. The Vaiṣṇava stage is the postgraduate status of a brāhmaṇa. A progressive brāhmaṇa must necessarily become a Vaiṣṇavafor a Vaiṣṇava is a self-realizedlearned brāhmaṇa."

Ultimately the aim of varṇāśrama-dharma is to turn a crude man into a pure devotee of the Lordor a Vaiṣṇava. Anyonethereforewho becomes a Vaiṣṇava accepted by the first-class Vaiṣṇavaor uttama-adhikārī Vaiṣṇavais already considered a brāhmaṇaregardless of his birth or past deeds. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted this principle and recognized Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura as the ācārya of the holy namealthough Ṭhākura Haridāsa appeared in a Mohammedan family. In conclusionŚrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī was born a Vaiṣṇavaandthereforebrahminism was included in him. He did not have to undergo any ceremonies. Any lowborn person—be he a KirātaHūṇaĀndhraPulindaPulkaśaĀbhīraŚumbhaYavanaKhasa or even lower—can be delivered to the highest transcendental position by the mercy of Vaiṣṇavas. Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī was the spiritual master of Śrī Sūta Gosvāmīwho therefore offers his respectful obeisances unto Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī before he begins his answers to the questions of the sages at Naimiṣāraṇya."
