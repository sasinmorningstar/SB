In any one of the above-mentioned castes and orders of lifethe four processesnamely glorifyinghearingremembering and worshipingare general occupations. Without these principles of lifeno one can exist. Activities of the living being involve engagements in these four different principles of life. Especially in modern societyall activities are more or less dependent on hearing and glorifying. Any man from any social status becomes a well-known man in human society within a very short time if he is simply glorified truly or falsely in the daily newspapers. Sometimes political leaders of a particular party are also advertised by newspaper propagandaand by such a method of glorification an insignificant man becomes an important man—within no time. But such propaganda by false glorification of an unqualified person cannot bring about any goodeither for the particular man or for the society. There may be some temporary reactions to such propagandabut there are no permanent effects. Therefore such activities are a waste of time. The actual object of glorification is the Supreme Personality of Godheadwho has created everything manifested before us. We have broadly discussed this fact from the beginning of the \"janmādy asya\"  śloka of this Bhāgavatam. The tendency to glorify others or hear others must be turned to the real object of glorification-the Supreme Being. And that will bring happiness."
