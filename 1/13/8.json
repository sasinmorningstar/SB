Vidura was more or less partial to the Pāṇḍavas due to their political position. Although Dhṛtarāṣṭra was equally careful for the minor children of Mahārāja Pāṇḍuhe was one of the intriguing parties who wanted to wash away the descendants of Pāṇḍu and replace them by raising his own sons to become the rulers of the kingdom. Mahātmā Vidura could follow this intrigue of Dhṛtarāṣṭra and companyand thereforeeven though he was a faithful servitor of his eldest brotherDhṛtarāṣṭrahe did not like his political ambition for the sake of his own sons. He was therefore very careful about the protection of the Pāṇḍavas and their widow mother. Thus he wasso to speakpartial to the Pāṇḍavaspreferring them to the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭraalthough both of them were equally affectionate in his ordinary eyes. He was equally affectionate to both the camps of nephews in the sense that he always chastised Duryodhana for his intriguing policy against his cousins. He always criticized his elder brother for his policy of encouragement to his sonsand at the same time he was always alert in giving special protection to the Pāṇḍavas. All these different activities of Vidura within the palace politics made him well-known as partial to the Pāṇḍavas. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira has referred to the past history of Vidura before his going away from home for a prolonged pilgrim's journey. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira reminded him that he was equally kind and partial to his grown-up nephewseven after the Battle of Kurukṣetraa great family disaster."

            "text": "Before the Battle of KurukṣetraDhṛtarāṣṭra's policy was peaceful annihilation of his nephewsand therefore he ordered Purocana to build a house at Vāraṇāvataand when the building was finished Dhṛtarāṣṭra desired that his brother's family live there for some time. When the Pāṇḍavas were going there in the presence of all the members of the royal familyVidura tactfully gave instructions to the Pāṇḍavas about the future plan of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. This is specifically described in the Mahābhārata (Adi-parva 114). He indirectly hinted\"A weapon not made of steel or any other material element can be more than sharp to kill an enemyand he who knows this is never killed.\" That is to sayhe hinted that the party of the Pāṇḍavas was being sent to Vāraṇāvata to be killedand thus he warned Yudhiṣṭhira to be very careful in their new residential palace. He also gave indications of fire and said that fire cannot extinguish the soul but can annihilate the material body. But one who protects the soul can live. Kuntī could not follow such indirect conversations between Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and Viduraand thus when she inquired from her son about the purport of the conversationYudhiṣṭhira replied that from the talks of Vidura it was understood that there was a hint of fire in the house where they were proceeding. Later onVidura came in disguise to the Pāṇḍavas and informed them that the housekeeper was going to set fire to the house on the fourteenth night of the waning moon. It was an intrigue of Dhṛtarāṣṭra that the Pāṇḍavas might die all together with their mother. And by his warning the Pāṇḍavas escaped through a tunnel underneath the earth so that their escape was also unknown to Dhṛtarāṣṭraso much so that after setting the firethe Kauravas were so certain of the death of the Pāṇḍavas that Dhṛtarāṣṭra performed the last rites of death with great cheerfulness. And during the mourning period all the members of the palace became overwhelmed with lamentationbut Vidura did not become sobecause of his knowledge that the Pāṇḍavas were alive somewhere. There are many such instances of calamitiesand in each of them Vidura gave protection to the Pāṇḍavas on one handand on the other he tried to restrain his brother Dhṛtarāṣṭra from such intriguing policies. Thereforehe was always partial to the Pāṇḍavasjust as a bird protects its eggs by its wing."
