            "text": "There are three classes of transcendentalistsnamely(1) the dhīraor the one who is not disturbed by being away from family association(2) one in the renounced order of lifea sannyāsī by frustrated sentimentand (3) a sincere devotee of the Lordwho awakens God consciousness by hearing and chanting and leaves home depending completely on the Personality of Godheadwho resides in his heart. The idea is that the renounced order of lifeafter a frustrated life of sentiment in the material worldmay be the stepping stone on the path of self-realizationbut real perfection of the path of liberation is attained when one is practiced to depend fully on the Supreme Personality of Godheadwho lives in everyone's heart as Paramātmā. One may live in the darkest jungle alone out of homebut a steadfast devotee knows very well that he is not alone. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is with himand He can protect His sincere devotee in any awkward circumstance. One should therefore practice devotional service at homehearing and chanting the holy namequalityformpastimesentourageetc.in association with pure devoteesand this practice will help one awaken God consciousness in proportion to one's sincerity of purpose. One who desires material benefit by such devotional activities can never depend on the Supreme Personality of Godheadalthough He sits in everyone's heart. Nor does the Lord give any direction to persons who worship Him for material gain. Such materialistic devotees may be blessed by the Lord with material benefitsbut they cannot reach the stage of the first-class human beingas above mentioned. There are many examples of such sincere devotees in the history of the worldespecially in Indiaand they are our guides on the path of self-realization. Mahātmā Vidura is one such great devotee of the Lordand we should all try to follow in his lotus footsteps for self-realization."
