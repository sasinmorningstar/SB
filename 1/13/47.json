The living beings who have come to the material world against the will of the Supreme Being are under the control of a supreme power called māyā-śaktithe deputed agent of the Lordand this daivī māyā is meant to pinch the conditioned souls by threefold miseriesone of which is explained here in this verse: the weak are the subsistence of the strong. No one is strong enough to protect himself from the onslaught of a strongerand by the will of the Lord there are systematic categories of the weakthe stronger and the strongest. There is nothing to be lamented if a tiger eats a weaker animalincluding a manbecause that is the law of the Supreme Lord. But although the law states that a human being must subsist on another living beingthere is the law of good sense alsofor the human being is meant to obey the laws of the scriptures. This is impossible for other animals. The human being is meant for self-realizationand for that purpose he is not to eat anything which is not first offered to the Lord. The Lord accepts from His devotee all kinds of food preparations made of vegetablesfruitsleaves and grains. Fruitsleaves and milk in different varieties can be offered to the Lordand after the Lord accepts the foodstuffthe devotee can partake of the prasādaby which all suffering in the struggle for existence will be gradually mitigated. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā . Even those who are accustomed to eat animals can offer foodstuffnot to the Lord directlybut to an agent of the Lordunder certain conditions of religious rites. Injunctions of the scriptures are meant not to encourage the eaters of animalsbut to restrict them by regulated principles."

No one should be very anxious for his subsistence in any circumstances because there are living beings everywhereand no living being starves for want of food at any place. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira is advised by Nārada not to worry about his uncles' suffering for want of foodfor they could live on vegetables available in the jungles as prasāda of the Supreme Lord and thus realize the path of salvation."

There is no possibility of checking this tendency by any artificial means under material conditions; it can be checked only by awakening the spiritual sense of the human being by practice of spiritual regulations. The spiritual regulative principleshoweverdo not allow a man to slaughter weaker animals on one side and teach others peaceful coexistence. If man does not allow the animals peaceful coexistencehow can he expect peaceful existence in human society? The blind leaders must therefore understand the Supreme Being and then try to implement the kingdom of God. The kingdom of Godor Rāma-rājyais impossible without the awakening of God consciousness in the mass mind of the people of the world."
