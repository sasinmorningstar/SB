Having obtained the human bodyI have neglected to worship Your Lordshipand therefore I have willingly drunk poison.\" In other wordsthe human body is especially meant for cultivating knowledge of devotional service to the Lordwithout which life becomes full of anxieties and miserable conditions. Thereforeone who has spoiled his life without such cultural activities is advised to leave home without knowledge of friends and relatives andbeing thus freed from all obligations of familysocietycountryetc.give up the body at some unknown destination so that others may not know where and how he has met his death. Dhīra means one who is not disturbedeven when there is sufficient provocation. One cannot give up a comfortable family life due to his affectionate relation with wife and children. Self-realization is obstructed by such undue affection for familyand if anyone is at all able to forget such a relationhe is called undisturbedor dhīra. This ishoweverthe path of renunciation based on a frustrated lifebut stabilization of such renunciation is possible only by association with bona fide saints and self-realized souls by which one can be engaged in the loving devotional service of the Lord. Sincere surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is possible by awakening the transcendental sense of service. This is made possible by association with pure devotees of the Lord. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was lucky enough to have a brother whose very association was a source of liberation for his frustrated life."
