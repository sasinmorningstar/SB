As a matter of facteveryone in the royal palaceincluding the King and his brothers and motherwas raptly attending the lectures. But it was known to Vidura that his instructions were especially meant for Dhṛtarāṣṭrawho was too materialistic. The word rājan is especially addressed to Dhṛtarāṣṭra significantly. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was the eldest son of his fatherand therefore according to law he was to be installed on the throne of Hastināpura. But because he was blind from birthhe was disqualified from his rightful claim. But he could not forget the bereavementand his disappointment was somewhat compensated after the death of Pāṇḍuhis younger brother. His younger brother left behind him some minor childrenand Dhṛtarāṣṭra became the natural guardian of thembut at heart he wanted to become the factual king and hand the kingdom over to his own sonsheaded by Duryodhana. With all these imperial ambitionsDhṛtarāṣṭra wanted to become a kingand he contrived all sorts of intrigues in consultation with his brother-in-law Śakuni. But everything failed by the will of the Lordand at the last stageeven after losing everythingmen and moneyhe wanted to remain as kingbeing the eldest uncle of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhiraas a matter of dutymaintained Dhṛtarāṣṭra in royal honorand Dhṛtarāṣṭra was happily passing away his numbered days in the illusion of being a king or the royal uncle of King Yudhiṣṭhira. Viduraas a saint and as the duty-bound affectionate youngest brother of Dhṛtarāṣṭrawanted to awaken Dhṛtarāṣṭra from his slumber of disease and old age. Vidura therefore sarcastically addressed Dhṛtarāṣṭra as the \"King,\" which he was actually not. Everyone is the servant of eternal timeand therefore no one can be king in this material world. King means the person who can order. The celebrated English king wanted to order time and tidebut the time and tide refused to obey his order. Therefore one is a false king in the material worldand Dhṛtarāṣṭra was particularly reminded of this false position and of the factual fearful happenings which had already approached him at that time. Vidura asked him to get out immediatelyif he wanted to be saved from the fearful situation which was approaching him fast. He did not ask Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira in that way because he knew that a king like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira is aware of all the fearful situations of this flimsy world and would take care of himselfin due courseeven though Vidura might not be present at that time."
