The conditioned soulthe living being in material existenceseeks happiness by employing his senses in the modes of materialismbut that cannot give him satisfaction. He then searches after the Supreme Truth by the empiric philosophic speculative method and intellectual feats. But if he does not find the ultimate goalhe again goes down to material activities and engages himself in various philanthropic and altruistic workswhich all fail to give him satisfaction. So neither fruitive activities nor dry philosophical speculation can give one satisfaction because by nature a living being is the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇaand all the Vedic literatures give him direction towards that ultimate end. The Bhagavad-gītā  confirms this statement."

            "text": "Like Viduraan inquisitive conditioned soul must approach a bona fide spiritual master like Maitreya and by intelligent inquiries must try to know everything about karma (fruitive activities)jñāna (philosophical research for the Supreme Truth) and yoga (the linking process of spiritual realization). One who is not seriously inclined to put questions before a spiritual master need not accommodate a show-bottle spiritual masternor should a person who may be a spiritual master for others pose to be so if he is unable to engage his disciple ultimately in the transcendental loving service of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Vidura was successful in approaching such a spiritual master like Maitreyaand he got the ultimate goal of life: bhakti unto Govinda. Thus there was nothing to be known further about spiritual progress."
