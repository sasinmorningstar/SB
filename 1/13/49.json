            "text": "There are two classes of human beingsnamely the envious and the obedient. Since the Supreme Lord is one and the father of all living beingsthe envious living beings are also His sonsbut they are known as the asuras. But the living beings who are obedient to the supreme father are called devatāsor demigodsbecause they are not contaminated by the material conception of life. Not only are the asuras envious of the Lord in even denying the existence of the Lordbut they are also envious of all other living beings. The predominance of asuras in the world is occasionally rectified by the Lord when He eliminates them from the world and establishes a rule of devatās like the Pāṇḍavas. His designation as kāla in disguise is significant. He is not at all dangerousbut He is the transcendental form of eternityknowledge and bliss. For the devotees His factual form is disclosedand for the nondevotees He appears like kāla-rūpawhich is causal form. This causal form of the Lord is not at all pleasing to the asurasand therefore they think of the Lord as formless in order to feel secure that they will not be vanquished by the Lord."
