The Yādavas and the Pāṇḍavaswho were always rapt in the thought of the Lord Kṛṣṇa and His different transcendental activitieswere all pure devotees of the Lord like Vidura. Vidura left home in order to devote himself completely to the service of the Lordbut the Pāṇḍavas and the Yādavas were always rapt in the thought of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Thus there is no difference in their pure devotional qualities. Either remaining at home or leaving homethe real qualification of a pure devotee is to become rapt in the thought of Kṛṣṇa favorablyi.e.knowing well that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Personality of Godhead. KaṁsaJarāsandhaŚiśupāla and other demons like them were also always rapt in the thought of Lord Kṛṣṇabut they were absorbed in a different waynamely unfavorablyor thinking Him to be a powerful man only. ThereforeKaṁsa and Śiśupāla are not on the same level as pure devotees like Vidurathe Pāṇḍavas and the Yādavas."
