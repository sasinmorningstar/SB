            "text": "The words kṛpaṇasya jijīviṣoḥ are significant. There are two classes of men. One is called the kṛpaṇaand the other is called the brāhmaṇa. The kṛpaṇaor the miserly manhas no estimation of his material bodybut the brāhmaṇa has a true estimation of himself and the material body. The kṛpaṇahaving a wrong estimation of his material bodywants to enjoy sense gratification with his utmost strengthand even in old age he wants to become a young man by medical treatment or otherwise. Dhṛtarāṣṭra is addressed herein as a kṛpaṇa because without any estimation of his material body he wants to live at any cost. Vidura is trying to open his eyes to see that he cannot live more than his term and that he must prepare for death. Since death is inevitablewhy should he accept such a humiliating position for living? It is better to take the right patheven at the risk of death. Human life is meant for finishing all kinds of miseries of material existenceand life should be so regulated that one can achieve the desired goal. Dhṛtarāṣṭradue to his wrong conception of lifehad already spoiled eighty percent of his achieved energyso it behooved him to utilize the remaining days of his miserly life for the ultimate good. Such a life is called miserly because one cannot properly utilize the assets of the human form of life. Only by good luck does such a miserly man meet a self-realized soul like Vidura and by his instruction gets rid of the nescience of material existence."
