            "text": "Vidura went out from the palace to detach himself from household affairsespecially political intrigues. As referred to hereinbeforehe was practically insulted by Duryodhana's calling him a son of a śūdrāṇīalthough it was not out of place to talk loosely in the case of one's grandmother. Vidura's motheralthough a śūdrāṇīwas the grandmother of Duryodhanaand funny talks are sometimes allowed between grandmother and grandchildren. But because the remark was an actual factit was unpalatable talk to Viduraand it was accepted as a direct insult. He therefore decided to quit his paternal house and prepare for the renounced order of life. This preparatory stage is called vānaprastha-āśramaor retired life for traveling and visiting the holy places on the surface of the earth. In the holy places of Indialike VṛndāvanaHardwarJagannātha Purīand Prayāgathere are many great devoteesand there are still free kitchen houses for persons who desire to advance spiritually. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was inquisitive to learn whether Vidura maintained himself by the mercy of the free kitchen houses (chatras)."
