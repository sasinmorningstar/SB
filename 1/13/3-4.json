She was the daughter of Mahārāja Subalathe King of Gāndhāra (now Kandahar in Kabul)and in her maiden state she worshiped Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva is generally worshiped by Hindu maidens to get a good husband. Gāndhārī satisfied Lord Śivaand by his benediction to obtain one hundred sonsshe was betrothed to Dhṛtarāṣṭradespite his being blind forever. When Gāndhārī came to know that her would-be husband was a blind manto follow her life companion she decided to become voluntarily blind. So she wrapped up her eyes with many silk linensand she was married to Dhṛtarāṣṭra under the guidance of her elder brother Śakuni. She was the most beautiful girl of her timeand she was equally qualified by her womanly qualitieswhich endeared every member of the Kaurava court. But despite all her good qualitiesshe had the natural frailties of a womanand she was envious of Kuntī when the latter gave birth to a male child. Both the queens were pregnantbut Kuntī first gave birth to a male child. Thus Gāndhārī became angry and gave a blow to her own abdomen. As a resultshe gave birth to a lump of flesh onlybut since she was a devotee of Vyāsadevaby the instruction of Vyāsadeva the lump was divided into one hundred partsand each part gradually developed to become a male child. Thus her ambition to become the mother of one hundred sons was fulfilledand she began to nourish all the children according to her exalted position. When the intrigue of the Battle of Kurukṣetra was going onshe was not in favor of fighting with the Pāṇḍavas; rathershe blamed Dhṛtarāṣṭraher husbandfor such a fratricidal war. She desired that the state be divided into two partsfor the sons of Pāṇḍu and her own. She was very affected when all her sons died in the Battle of Kurukṣetraand she wanted to curse Bhīmasena and Yudhiṣṭhirabut she was checked by Vyāsadeva. Her mourning over the death of Duryodhana and Duḥśāsana before Lord Kṛṣṇa was very pitifuland Lord Kṛṣṇa pacified her by transcendental messages. She was equally aggrieved on the death of Karṇaand she described to Lord Kṛṣṇa the lamentation of Karṇa's wife. She was pacified by Śrīla Vyāsadeva when he showed her dead sonsthen promoted to the heavenly kingdoms. She died along with her husband in the jungles of the Himalayas near the mouth of the Ganges; she burned in a forest fire. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira performed the death ceremony of his uncle and aunt."

She is the incarnation of the success potency of the Personality of Godhead. The heavenly denizens from the upper planets used to visit the palace of King Kuntibhojaand Kuntī was engaged for their reception. She also served the great mystic sage Durvāsāand being satisfied by her faithful serviceDurvāsā Muni gave her a mantra by which it was possible for her to call for any demigod she pleased. As a matter of inquisitivenessshe at once called for the sun-godwho desired couplement with herbut she declined. But the sun-god assured her immunity from virgin adulterationand so she agreed to his proposal. As a result of this couplementshe became pregnantand Karṇa was born by her. By the grace of the sunshe again turned into a virgin girlbut being afraid of her parentsshe quitted the newly born childKarṇa. After thatwhen she actually selected her own husbandshe preferred Pāṇḍu to be her husband. Mahārāja Pāṇḍu later wanted to retire from family life and adopt the renounced order of life. Kuntī refused to allow her husband to adopt such lifebut at last Mahārāja Pāṇḍu gave her permission to become a mother of sons by calling some other suitable personalities. Kuntī did not accept this proposal at firstbut when vivid examples were set by Pāṇḍu she agreed. Thus by dint of the mantra awarded by Durvāsā Muni she called for Dharmarājaand thus Yudhiṣṭhira was born. She called for the demigod Vāyu (air)and thus Bhīma was born. She called for Indrathe King of heavenand thus Arjuna was born. The other two sonsnamely Nakula and Sahadevawere begotten by Pāṇḍu himself in the womb of Mādrī. Later onMahārāja Pāṇḍu died at an early agefor which Kuntī was so aggrieved that she fainted. Two co-wivesnamely Kuntī and Mādrīdecided that Kuntī should live for the maintenance of the five minor childrenthe Pāṇḍavasand Mādrī should accept the satī rituals by meeting voluntary death along with her husband. This agreement was endorsed by great sages like Śataśṛṅga and others present on the occasion."

During the forest life one demon girlHiḍimbāwanted Bhīma as her husband. Bhīma refusedbut when the girl approached Kuntī and Yudhiṣṭhirathey ordered Bhīma to accept her proposal and give her a son. As a result of this combinationGhaṭotkaca was bornand he fought very valiantly with his father against the Kauravas. In their forest life they lived with a brāhmaṇa family that was in trouble because of one Bakāsura demonand Kuntī ordered Bhīma to kill the Bakāsura to protect the brāhmaṇa family against troubles created by the demon. She advised Yudhiṣṭhira to start for the Pāñcāladeśa. Draupadī was gained in this Pāñcāladeśa by Arjunabut by order of Kuntī all five of the Pāṇḍava brothers became equally the husbands of Pāñcālīor Draupadī. She was married with five Pāṇḍavas in the presence of Vyāsadeva. Kuntīdevī never forgot her first childKarṇaand after Karṇa's death in the Battle of Kurukṣetra she lamented and admitted before her other sons that Karṇa was her eldest son prior to her marriage with Mahārāja Pāṇḍu. Her prayers for the Lord after the Battle of Kurukṣetrawhen Lord Kṛṣṇa was going back homeare excellently explained. Later she went to the forest with Gāndhārī for severe penance. She used to take meals after each thirty days. She finally sat down in profound meditation and later burned to ashes in a forest fire."

She is therefore the sister of Dhṛṣṭadyumnaand she is also named Pāñcālī. The five Pāṇḍavas married her as a common wifeand each of them begot a son in her. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira begot a son named PratibhitBhīmasena begot a son named SutasomaArjuna begot ŚrutakīrtiNakula begot Śatānīkaand Sahadeva begot Śrutakarmā. She is described as a most beautiful ladyequal to her mother-in-lawKuntī. During her birth there was an aeromessage that she should be called Kṛṣṇā. The same message also declared that she was born to kill many a kṣatriya. By dint of her blessings from Śaṅkarashe was awarded five husbandsequally qualified. When she preferred to select her own husbandprinces and kings were invited from all the countries of the world. She was married with the Pāṇḍavas during their exile in the forestbut when they went back home Mahārāja Drupada gave them immense wealth as a dowry. She was well received by all the daughters-in-law of Dhṛtarāṣṭra. When she was lost in a gambling gameshe was forcibly dragged into the assembly halland an attempt was made by Duḥśāsana to see her naked beautyeven though there were elderly persons like Bhīṣma and Droṇa present. She was a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇaand by her prayingthe Lord Himself became an unlimited garment to save her from the insult. A demon of the name Jaṭāsura kidnapped herbut her second husbandBhīmasenakilled the demon and saved her. She saved the Pāṇḍavas from the curse of Maharṣi Durvāsā by the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa. When the Pāṇḍavas lived incognito in the palace of VirāṭaKīcaka was attracted by her exquisite beautyand by arrangement with Bhīma the devil was killed and she was saved. She was very much aggrieved when her five sons were killed by Aśvatthāmā. At the last stageshe accompanied her husband Yudhiṣṭhira and others and fell on the way. The cause of her falling was explained by Yudhiṣṭhirabut when Yudhiṣṭhira entered the heavenly planet he saw Draupadī gloriously present there as the goddess of fortune in the heavenly planet."

The two brothers and sister are represented in the famous Jagannātha temple of Purīand the temple is still visited by thousands of pilgrims daily. This temple is in remembrance of the Lord's visit at Kurukṣetra during an occasion of solar eclipse and His subsequent meeting with the residents of Vṛndāvana. The meeting of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa during this occasion is a very pathetic storyand Lord Śrī Caitanyain the ecstasy of Rādhārāṇīalways pined for Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa at Jagannātha Purī. While Arjuna was at Dvārakāhe wanted to have Subhadrā as his queenand he expressed his desire to Lord Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Kṛṣṇa knew that His elder brotherLord Baladevawas arranging her marriage elsewhereand since He did not dare to go against the arrangement of BaladevaHe advised Arjuna to kidnap Subhadrā. So when all of them were on a pleasure trip on the Raivata HillArjuna managed to kidnap Subhadrā according to the plan of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Śrī Baladeva was very angry at Arjunaand He wanted to kill himbut Lord Kṛṣṇa implored His brother to excuse Arjuna. Then Subhadrā was duly married with Arjunaand Abhimanyu was born of Subhadrā. At the premature death of AbhimanyuSubhadrā was very mortifiedbut on the birth of Parīkṣit she was happy and solaced."
