Our duration of life is measuredand no one is able to enhance it even by a second against the scheduled time ordained by the supreme will. Such valuable timeespecially for the human beingshould be cautiously spent because even a second passed away imperceptibly cannot be replacedeven in exchange for thousands of golden coins amassed by hard labor. Every second of human life is meant for making an ultimate solution to the problems of lifei.e. repetition of birth and death and revolving in the cycle of 8,400,000 different species of life. The material bodywhich is subject to birth and deathdiseases and old ageis the cause of all sufferings of the living beingotherwise the living being is eternal; he is never bornnor does he ever die. Foolish persons forget this problem. They do not know at all how to solve the problems of lifebut become engrossed in temporary family affairs not knowing that eternal time is passing away imperceptibly and that their measured duration of life is diminishing every secondwithout any solution to the big problemnamely repetition of birth and deathdisease and old age. This is called illusion."

            "text": "But such illusion cannot work on one who is awake in the devotional service of the Lord. Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja and his brothers the Pāṇḍavas were all engaged in the service of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇaand they had very little attraction for the illusory happiness of this material world. As we have discussed previouslyMahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was fixed in the service of the Lord Mukunda (the Lordwho can award salvation)and therefore he had no attraction even for such comforts of life as are available in the kingdom of heavenbecause even the happiness obtained on the planet Brahmaloka is also temporary and illusory. Because the living being is eternalhe can be happy only in the eternal abode of the kingdom of God (paravyoma)from which no one returns to this region of repeated birth and deathdisease and old age. Thereforeany comfort of life or any material happiness which does not warrant an eternal life is but illusion for the eternal living being. One who understands this factually is learnedand such a learned person can sacrifice any amount of material happiness to achieve the desired goal known as brahma-sukhamor absolute happiness. Real transcendentalists are hungry for this happinessand as a hungry man cannot be made happy by all comforts of life minus foodstuffso the man hungry for eternal absolute happiness cannot be satisfied by any amount of material happiness. Thereforethe instruction described in this verse cannot be applied to Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira or his brothers and mother. It was meant for persons like Dhṛtarāṣṭrafor whom Vidura came especially to impart lessons."
