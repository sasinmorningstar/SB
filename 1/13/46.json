A conditioned living being is under the full control of material naturerepresented by eternal time and activities under the dictation of different modes of nature. There are three material modes of naturenamely goodnesspassion and ignorance. Unless one is situated in the mode of goodnessone cannot see things as they are. The passionate and the ignorant cannot even see things as they are. Therefore a person who is passionate and ignorant cannot direct his activities on the right path. Only the man in the quality of goodness can help to a certain extent. Most persons are passionate and ignorantand therefore their plans and projects can hardly do any good to others. Above the modes of nature is eternal timewhich is called kāla because it changes the shape of everything in the material world. Even if we are able to do something temporarily beneficialtime will see that the good project is frustrated in course of time. The only thing possible to be done is to get rid of eternal timekālawhich is compared to kāla-sarpaor the cobra snakewhose bite is always lethal. No one can be saved from the bite of a cobra. The best remedy for getting out of the clutches of the cobralike kāla or its integritythe modes of natureis bhakti-yogaas it is recommended in the Bhagavad-gītā  confirms this definitely."
