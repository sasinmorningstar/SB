            "text": "Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhuthe great preacher of the principles of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatamhas stressed the importance of association with sādhuspure devotees of the Lord. He said that even by a moments association with a pure devoteeone can achieve all perfection. We are not ashamed to admit that this fact was experienced in our practical life. Were we not favored by His Divine Grace Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārājaby our first meeting for a few minutes onlyit would have been impossible for us to accept this mighty task of describing Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in English. Without seeing him at that opportune momentwe could have become a very great business magnatebut never would we have been able to walk the path of liberation and be engaged in the factual service of the Lord under instructions of His Divine Grace. And here is another practical example by the action of Vidura's association with Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Mahārāja Dhṛtarāṣṭra was tightly bound in a network of material affinities related to politicseconomy and family attachmentand he did everything in his power to achieve so-called success in his planned projectsbut he was frustrated from the beginning to the end so far as his material activities were concerned. And yetdespite his life of failurehe achieved the greatest of all success in self-realization by the forceful instructions of a pure devotee of the Lordwho is the typical emblem of a sādhu. The scriptures enjointhereforethat one should associate with sādhus onlyrejecting all other kinds of associationand by doing so one will have ample opportunity to hear the sādhuswho can cut to pieces the bonds of illusory affection in the material world. It is a fact that the material world is a great illusion because everything appears to be a tangible reality but at the next moment evaporates like the dashing foam of the sea or a cloud in the sky. A cloud in the sky undoubtedly appears to be a reality because it rainsand due to rains so many temporary green things appearbut in the ultimate issueeverything disappearsnamely the cloudrain and green vegetationall in due course. But the sky remainsand the varieties of sky or luminaries also remain forever. Similarlythe Absolute Truthwhich is compared to the skyremains eternallyand the temporary cloudlike illusion comes and goes away. Foolish living beings are attracted by the temporary cloudbut intelligent men are more concerned with the eternal sky with all its variegatedness."
