            "text": "Dhṛtarāṣṭra had attainedby the yogic processthe stage of negation of all sorts of material reaction. The effects of the material modes of nature draw the victim to indefatigable desires of enjoying matterbut one can escape such false enjoyment by the yogic process. Every sense is always busy in searching for its foodand thus the conditioned soul is assaulted from all sides and has no chance to become steady in any pursuit. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was advised by Nārada not to disturb his uncle by attempting to bring him back home. He was now beyond the attraction of anything material. The material modes of nature (the guṇas) have their different modes of activitiesbut above the material modes of nature is a spiritual modewhich is absolute. Nirguṇa means without reaction. The spiritual mode and its effect are identical; therefore the spiritual quality is distinguished from its material counterpart by the word nirguṇa. After complete suspension of the material modes of natureone is admitted to the spiritual sphereand action dictated by the spiritual modes is called devotional serviceor bhakti. Bhakti is therefore nirguṇa attained by direct contact with the Absolute."
