            "text": "The Supreme Lord Personality of Godhead is one without a secondbut He manifests Himself by different energies because He is by nature blissful. The living beings are also manifestations of His marginal energyqualitatively one with the Lordand there are innumerable living beings both within and without the external and internal energies of the Lord. Since the spiritual world is a manifestation of the Lord's internal energythe living beings within that internal potency are qualitatively one with the Lord without contamination from the external potency. Although qualitatively one with the Lordthe living beingdue to contamination of the material worldis pervertedly manifestedand therefore he experiences so-called happiness and distress in the material world. Such experiences are all ephemeral and do not affect the spirit soul. The perception of such ephemeral happiness and distress is due only to the forgetfulness of his qualitieswhich are equal to the Lord's. There ishowevera regular current from the Lord Himselffrom within and withoutby which to rectify the fallen condition of the living being. From within He corrects the desiring living beings as localized Paramātmāand from without He corrects by His manifestationsthe spiritual master and the revealed scriptures. One should look unto the Lord; one should not be disturbed by the so-called manifestations of happiness or distressbut he should try to cooperate with the Lord in His outward activities for correcting the fallen souls. By His order onlyone should become a spiritual master and cooperate with the Lord. One should not become a spiritual master for one's personal benefitfor some material gain or as an avenue of business or occupation for earning livelihood. Bona fide spiritual masters who look unto the Supreme Lord to cooperate with Him are actually qualitatively one with the Lordand the forgetful ones are perverted reflections only. Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja is advised by Nāradathereforenot to be disturbed by the affairs of so-called happiness and distressbut to look only unto the Lord to execute the mission for which the Lord has descended. That was his prime duty."
