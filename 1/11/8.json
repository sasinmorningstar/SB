The Lord is never impersonalbut He is the Supreme Absolute Personality of Godheadpossible to be visited by devotional service face to facewhich is impossible to be done even by the denizens of higher planets. When Brahmājī and other demigods want to consult Lord Viṣṇuthe plenary portion of Lord Kṛṣṇathey have to wait on the shore of the ocean of milk where Lord Viṣṇu is lying on White Land (Śvetadvīpa). This ocean of milk and the Śvetadvīpa planet are the replica of Vaikuṇṭhaloka within the universe. Neither Brahmājī nor the demigods like Indra can enter into this island of Śvetadvīpabut they can stand on the shore of the ocean of milk and transmit their message to Lord Viṣṇuknown as Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Thereforethe Lord is rarely seen by thembut the inhabitants of Dvārakābecause of their being pure devotees without any tinge of the material contamination of fruitive activities and empiric philosophical speculationcan see Him face to face by the grace of the Lord. This is the original state of the living entities and can be attained by reviving our natural and constitutional state of lifewhich is discovered by devotional service only."
