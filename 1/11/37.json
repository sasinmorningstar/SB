            "text": "The word abudhaḥ is significant here. Due to ignorance onlythe foolish mundane wranglers misunderstand the Supreme Lord and spread their foolish imaginations amongst innocent persons by propaganda. The Supreme Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original primeval Personality of Godheadand when He was personally present before the eyes of everyoneHe displayed full-fledged divine potency in every field of activities. As we have already explained in the first verse of Śrīmad-BhāgavatamHe is completely independent to act however He likesbut all His actions are full of blissknowledge and eternity. Only the foolish mundaners misunderstand Himunaware of His eternal form of knowledge and blisswhich is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā and Upaniṣads. His different potencies work in a perfect plan of natural sequenceand doing everything by the agency of His different potenciesHe remains eternally the supreme independent. When He descends on the material world by His causeless mercy to different living beingsHe does so by His own potency. He is not subject to any condition of the material modes of natureand He descends as He is originally. The mental speculators misunderstand Him as the Supreme Personand they consider His impersonal features as inexplicable Brahman to be all. Such a conception is also the product of conditioned life because they cannot go beyond their own personal capacity. Thereforeone who considers the Lord on the level of one's limited potency is only a common man. Such a man cannot be convinced that the Personality of Godhead is always unaffected by the modes of material nature. He cannot understand that the sun is always unaffected by infectious matter. The mental speculators compare everything from the standpoint of experimental knowledge of their own selves. Thus when the Lord is found to act like an ordinary person in matrimonial bondagethey consider Him to be like one of themwithout considering that the Lord can at once marry sixteen thousand wives or more. Due to a poor fund of knowledge they accept one side of the picture while disbelieving the other. This means that due to ignorance only they always think of Lord Kṛṣṇa as like themselves and make their own conclusionswhich are absurd and unauthentic from the version of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam."
