Here the word yathā-vidhior \"just as it behooves\" is significant. He reciprocates \"just as it behooves\" with His different types of admirers and devotees. Of coursethe pure devotees are of one type only because they have no other object for service but the Lordand therefore the Lord also reciprocates with such pure devotees just as it behoovesnamelyHe is always attentive to all the matters of His pure devotees. There are others who designate Him as impersonaland so the Lord also does not take any personal interest. He satisfies everyone in terms of one's development of spiritual consciousnessand a sample of such reciprocation is exhibited here with His different welcomers."
