This is still followed by the devout ladies of India. Especially during the days of the Jhulana and Janmāṣṭamī ceremoniesthe ladies of India still throng up in the greatest number at the temple of the Lordwhere His transcendental eternal form is worshiped. The transcendental form of the Lord installed in a temple is not different from the Lord personally. Such a form of the Lord is called arca-vigrahaor arcā incarnationand is expanded by the Lord by His internal potency just to facilitate the devotional service of His innumerable devotees who are in the material world. The material senses cannot perceive the spiritual nature of the Lordand therefore the Lord accepts the arca-vigrahawhich is apparently made of material elements like earthwood and stone but actually there is no material contamination. The Lord being kaivalya (one alone)there is no matter in Him. He is one without a secondand therefore the Almighty Lord can appear in any form without being contaminated by the material conception. Thereforefestivities in the temple of the Lordas held generallyare like festivals performed during the manifestive days of the Lord of Dvārakāabout five thousand years ago. The authorized ācāryaswho know the science perfectlyinstall such temples of the Lord under regulative principles just to offer facilities to the common manbut persons who are less intelligentwithout being conversant with the sciencemistake this great attempt to be idol worship and poke their nose into that to which they have no access. Thereforethe ladies or men who observe festivals in the temples of the Lord just to have a look at the transcendental form are a thousand times more glorious than those who are nonbelievers in the transcendental form of the Lord."

The ladies got up on the roofs just to have a look at the procession and the Lord. The ladies did not mix with the crowd on the streetand thus their respectability was perfectly observed. There was no artificial equality with the man. Female respectability is preserved more elegantly by keeping the woman separate from the man. The sexes should not mix unrestrictedly."
