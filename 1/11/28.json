But in spite of thisall other stepmothers were equally affectionate to Himas will be evident from the following verse. Lord Kṛṣṇa also did not distinguish His real mother from His stepmothersand He equally offered His obeisances unto all the wives of Vasudeva present on the occasion. According to scriptures alsothere are seven mothers: (1) the real mother(2) the wife of the spiritual master(3) the wife of a brāhmaṇa(4) the wife of the king(5) the cow(6) the nurseand (7) the earth. All of them are mothers. Even by this injunction of the śāstrasthe stepmotherwho is the wife of the fatheris also as good as the mother because the father is also one of the spiritual masters. Lord Kṛṣṇathe Lord of the universeplays the part of an ideal son just to teach others how to treat their stepmothers."
