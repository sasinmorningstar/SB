            "text": "In the Vedas and Vedic literatures (Śruti and Smṛti) it is affirmed that in the Divinity there is nothing material. He is transcendental (nirguṇa) onlythe supreme cognizant. Harior the Personality of Godheadis the supreme transcendental person situated beyond the range of material affection. These statements are also confirmed even by Ācārya Śaṅkara. One may argue that His relation with the goddesses of fortune may be transcendentalbut what about His relation with the Yadu dynastybeing born in that familyor His killing the nonbelievers like Jarāsandha and other asuras directly in contact with the modes of material nature. The answer is that the divinity of the Personality of Godhead is never in contact with the qualities of material nature in any circumstances. Actually He is in contact with such qualities because He is the ultimate source of everythingyet He is above the actions of such qualities. He is knownthereforeas Yogeśvaraor the master of mystic poweror in other words the all-powerful. Even His learned devotees are not affected by the influence of the material modes. The great six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana all came from greatly rich and aristocratic familiesbut when they adopted the life of mendicants at Vṛndāvanasuperficially they appeared to be in wretched conditions of lifebut factually they were the richest of all in spiritual values. Such mahā-bhāgavatasor first-grade devoteesalthough moving amongst menare not contaminated by honor or insulthunger or satisfactionsleep or wakefulnesswhich are all resultant actions of the three modes of material nature. Similarlysome of them are engaged in worldly dealingsyet are unaffected. Unless these neutralities of life are thereone cannot be considered situated in transcendence. The Divinity and His associates are on the same transcendental planeand their glories are always sanctified by the action of yogamāyāor the internal potency of the Lord. The devotees of the Lord are always transcendentaleven if they are sometimes found to have fallen in their behavior. The Lord emphatically declares in the Bhagavad-gītā  that even if an unalloyed devotee is found to be fallen due to a previous material contaminationhe is nevertheless to be accepted as fully transcendental because of his being engaged cent percent in the devotional service of the Lord. The Lord protects him always because of his rendering service unto Himand the fallen conditions are to be considered accidental and temporary. They will vanish in no time."
