Full description of these palaces is given in the Tenth Canto. All the palaces were made of the best marble stone. They were illuminated by jewels and decorated by curtains and carpets of velvet and silknicely bedecked and embroidered with gold lace. The Personality of Godhead means one who is full with all powerall energyall opulencesall beautiesall knowledge and all renunciation. Thereforein the palaces of the Lord there was nothing wanting for fulfilling all desires of the Lord. The Lord is unlimitedand therefore His desires are also unlimitedand the supply is also unlimited. Everything being unlimitedit is concisely described here as sama-kāmamor full with all desirable equipment."
