Subhadrā was married with her cousin Arjunaand this system is still prevalent in some parts of India. Vasudeva was appointed minister of Ugrasenaand later on he married eight daughters of Ugrasena's brother Devaka. Devakī is only one of them. Kaṁsa was his brother-in-lawand Vasudeva accepted voluntary imprisonment by Kaṁsa on mutual agreement to deliver the eighth son of Devakī. This was foiled by the will of Kṛṣṇa. As maternal uncle of the Pāṇḍavashe took active parts in the purificatory process of the Pāṇḍavas. He sent for the priest Kaśyapa at the Śatasṛṅga Parvataand he executed the functions. When Kṛṣṇa appeared within the bars of Kaṁsa's prison houseHe was transferred by Vasudeva to the house of Nanda Mahārājathe foster father of Kṛṣṇaat Gokula. Kṛṣṇa disappeared along with Baladeva prior to the disappearance of Vasudevaand Arjuna (Vasudeva's nephew) undertook the charge of the funeral ceremony after Vasudeva's disappearance."

Akrūra attained success in devotional service to the Lord by the one single process of offering prayers. He was the husband of Sūtanīdaughter of Ahūka. He supported Arjuna when Arjuna took Subhadrā forcibly away by the will of Kṛṣṇa. Both Kṛṣṇa and Akrūra went to see Arjuna after his successful kidnapping of Subhadrā. Both of them presented dowries to Arjuna after this incidence. Akrūra was present also when Abhimanyuthe son of Subhadrāwas married with Uttarāmother of Mahārāja Parīkṣit.

This Kaṁsa imprisoned his father and became the King of Mathurā. By the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa and His brotherLord BaladevaKaṁsa was killedand Ugrasena was reinstalled on the throne. When Śālva attacked the city of DvārakāUgrasena fought very valiantly and repulsed the enemy. Ugrasena inquired from Nāradajī about the divinity of Lord Kṛṣṇa. When the Yadu dynasty was to be vanquishedUgrasena was entrusted with the iron lump produced from the womb of Sāmba. He cut the iron lump into pieces and then pasted it and mixed it up with the sea water on the coast of Dvārakā. After thishe ordered complete prohibition within the city of Dvārakā and the kingdom. He got salvation after his death."

He was also entrusted to Nanda Mahārāja along with His motherRohiṇīwhen Vasudeva embraced imprisonment by mutual agreement with Kaṁsa. So Nanda Mahārāja is also the foster father of Baladeva along with Lord Kṛṣṇa. Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Baladeva were constant companions from Their very childhoodalthough They were stepbrothers. He is the plenary manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godheadand therefore He is as good and powerful as Lord Kṛṣṇa. He belongs to the viṣṇu-tattva (the principle of Godhead). He attended the svayaṁvara ceremony of Draupadī along with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. When Subhadrā was kidnapped by Arjuna by the organized plan of Śrī KṛṣṇaBaladeva was very angry with Arjuna and wanted to kill him at once. Śrī Kṛṣṇafor the sake of His dear friendfell at the feet of Lord Baladeva and implored Him not to be so angry. Śrī Baladeva was thus satisfied. SimilarlyHe was once very angry with the Kauravasand He wanted to throw their whole city into the depths of the Yamunā. But the Kauravas satisfied Him by surrendering unto His divine lotus feet. He was actually the seventh son of Devakī prior to the birth of Lord Kṛṣṇabut by the will of the Lord He was transferred to the womb of Rohiṇī to escape the wrath of Kaṁsa. His other name is therefore Saṅkarṣaṇawho is also the plenary portion of Śrī Baladeva. Because He is as powerful as Lord Kṛṣṇa and can bestow spiritual power to the devoteesHe is therefore known as Baladeva. In the Vedas also it is enjoined that no one can know the Supreme Lord without being favored by Baladeva. Bala means spiritual strength not physical. Some less intelligent persons interpret bala as the strength of the body. But no one can have spiritual realization by physical strength. Physical strength ends with the end of the physical bodybut spiritual strength follows the spirit soul to the next transmigrationand therefore the strength obtained by Baladeva is never wasted. The strength is eternaland thus Baladeva is the original spiritual master of all devotees."

In His childhood He killed many asuras along with Śrī Kṛṣṇaand specifically He killed the Dhenukāsura at Tālavana. During the Kurukṣetra battleHe remained neutraland He tried His best not to bring about the fight. He was in favor of Duryodhanabut still He remained neutral. When there was a club-fight between Duryodhana and BhīmasenaHe was present on the spot. He was angry at Bhīmasena when the latter struck Duryodhana on the thigh or below the beltand He wanted to retaliate the unfair action. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa saved Bhīma from His wrath. But He left the place at oncebeing disgusted at Bhīmasenaand after His departure Duryodhana fell to the ground to meet his death. The funeral ceremony of Abhimanyuthe son of Arjunawas performed by Himas He was the maternal uncle. It was impossible to be performed by any one of the Pāṇḍavaswho were all overwhelmed with grief. At the last stageHe departed from this world by producing a great white snake from His mouthand thus He was carried by Śeṣanāga in the shape of a serpent."

The ṛṣis replied that he would deliver a lump of ironwhich would be the cause of fratricidal war in the family of Yadu.
