Because we are all eternally related with Him as the sun rays are eternally related with the sun disc. The sun rays are molecular parts of the solar radiation. Thus the sun rays and the sun cannot be separated. The separation by the cloud is temporary and artificialand as soon as the cloud is clearedthe sun rays again display their natural effulgence in the presence of the sun. Similarlythe living entitieswho are molecular parts of the whole spiritare separated from the Lord by the artificial covering of māyāillusory energy. This illusory energyor the curtain of māyāhas to be removedand when it is so donethe living entity can see the Lord face to faceand all his miseries are at once removed. Every one of us wants to remove the miseries of lifebut we do not know how to do it. The solution is given hereand it rests on us to assimilate it or not."
