            "text": "Here are some of the specific symbolical marks on the spiritual body of the Personality of Godhead which distinguish His body from the bodies of all others. They are all special features of the body of the Lord. The Lord may appear as one of usbut He is always distinct by His specific bodily features. Śrīmatī Kuntī claims herself unfit to see the Lord because of her being a woman. This is claimed because womenśūdras (the laborer class) and the dvija-bandhusor the wretched descendants of the higher three classesare unfit by intelligence to understand transcendental subject matter concerning the spiritual namefameattributesformsetc.of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Such personsalthough they are unfit to enter into the spiritual affairs of the Lordcan see Him as the arcā-vigrahawho descends on the material world just to distribute favors to the fallen soulsincluding the above-mentioned womenśūdras and dvija-bandhus. Because such fallen souls cannot see anything beyond matterthe Lord condescends to enter into each and every one of the innumerable universes as the Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇuwho grows a lotus stem from the lotuslike depression in the center of His transcendental abdomenand thus Brahmāthe first living being in the universeis born. Thereforethe Lord is known as the Paṅkajanābhi. The Paṅkajanābhi Lord accepts the arcā-vigraha (His transcendental form) in different elementsnamely a form within the minda form made of wooda form made of eartha form made of metala form made of jewela form made of painta form drawn on sandetc. All such forms of the Lord are always decorated with garlands of lotus flowersand there should be a soothing atmosphere in the temple of worship to attract the burning attention of the nondevotees always engaged in material wranglings. The meditators worship a form within the mind. Thereforethe Lord is merciful even to the womenśūdras and dvija-bandhusprovided they agree to visit the temple of worship in different forms made for them. Such temple visitors are not idolatersas alleged by some men with a poor fund of knowledge. All the great ācāryas established such temples of worship in all places just to favor the less intelligentand one should not pose himself as transcending the stage of temple worship while one is actually in the category of the śūdras and the women or less. One should begin to see the Lord from His lotus feetgradually rising to the thighswaistchest and face. One should not try to look at the face of the Lord without being accustomed to seeing the lotus feet of the Lord. Śrīmatī Kuntībecause of her being the aunt of the Lorddid not begin to see the Lord from the lotus feet because the Lord might feel ashamedand thus Kuntīdevījust to save a painful situation for the Lordbegan to see the Lord just above His lotus feeti.e.from the waist of the Lordgradually rising to the faceand then down to the lotus feet. In the roundeverything there is in order."
