This signifies that the power of King Yudhiṣṭhira was loving affectionwhich the Lord could not deny. The almighty God is thus conquered only by loving service and nothing else. He is fully independent in all His dealingsbut He voluntarily accepts obligations by the loving affection of His pure devotees."
