Otherswho are thriving on misdeeds onlyregardless of statuscannot approach the Supreme due to being misled by the illusory energy. Thereforefor a pious personif there is some calamity there is no other alternative than to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. Constantly remembering the lotus feet of the Lord means preparing for liberation from birth and death. Thereforeeven though there are so-called calamitiesthey are welcome because they give us an opportunity to remember the Lordwhich means liberation."

Less intelligent persons prepare plans to adjust to those calamities without knowing that the nature of this place is itself full of calamities. They have no information of the abode of the Lordwhich is full of bliss and without trace of calamity. The duty of the sane personthereforeis to be undisturbed by worldly calamitieswhich are sure to happen in all circumstances. Suffering all sorts of unavoidable misfortunesone should make progress in spiritual realization because that is the mission of human life. The spirit soul is transcendental to all material calamities; thereforethe so-called calamities are called false. A man may see a tiger swallowing him in a dreamand he may cry for this calamity. Actually there is no tiger and there is no suffering; it is simply a case of dreams. In the same wayall calamities of life are said to be dreams. If someone is lucky enough to get in contact with the Lord by devotional serviceit is all gain. Contact with the Lord by any one of the nine devotional services is always a forward step on the path going back to Godhead."
