The Pāṇḍavas are undoubtedly well established in name and fame and are guided by the great King Yudhiṣṭhirawho is morality personifiedand the Yadus are undoubtedly great alliesbut without the guidance of Lord Kṛṣṇa all of them are nonentitiesas much as the senses of the body are useless without the guidance of consciousness. No one should be proud of his prestigepower and fame without being guided by the favor of the Supreme Lord. The living beings are always dependentand the ultimate dependable object is the Lord Himself. We maythereforeinvent by our advancement of material knowledge all sorts of counteracting material resourcesbut without being guided by the Lord all such inventions end in fiascohowever strong and stout the reactionary elements may be."
