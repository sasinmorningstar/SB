            "text": "Human prosperity flourishes by natural gifts and not by gigantic industrial enterprises. The gigantic industrial enterprises are products of a godless civilizationand they cause the destruction of the noble aims of human life. The more we go on increasing such troublesome industries to squeeze out the vital energy of the human beingthe more there will be unrest and dissatisfaction of the people in generalalthough a few only can live lavishly by exploitation. The natural gifts such as grains and vegetablesfruitsriversthe hills of jewels and mineralsand the seas full of pearls are supplied by the order of the Supremeand as He desiresmaterial nature produces them in abundance or restricts them at times. The natural law is that the human being may take advantage of these godly gifts by nature and satisfactorily flourish on them without being captivated by the exploitative motive of lording it over material nature. The more we attempt to exploit material nature according to our whims of enjoymentthe more we shall become entrapped by the reaction of such exploitative attempts. If we have sufficient grainsfruitsvegetables and herbsthen what is the necessity of running a slaughterhouse and killing poor animals? A man need not kill an animal if he has sufficient grains and vegetables to eat. The flow of river waters fertilizes the fieldsand there is more than what we need. Minerals are produced in the hillsand the jewels in the ocean. If the human civilization has sufficient grainsmineralsjewelswatermilketc.then why should it hanker after terrible industrial enterprises at the cost of the labor of some unfortunate men? But all these natural gifts are dependent on the mercy of the Lord. What we needthereforeis to be obedient to the laws of the Lord and achieve the perfection of human life by devotional service. The indications by Kuntīdevī are just to the point. She desires that God's mercy be bestowed upon them so that natural prosperity be maintained by His grace."
