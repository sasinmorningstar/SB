Abhimanyu's widowUttarāshould have followed the path of her husbandbut because she was pregnantand Mahārāja Parīkṣita great devotee of the Lordwas lying in embryoshe was responsible for his protection. The mother of a child has a great responsibility in giving all protection to the childand therefore Uttarā was not ashamed to express this frankly before Lord Kṛṣṇa. Uttarā was the daughter of a great kingthe wife of a great heroand student of a great devoteeand later she was the mother of a good king also. She was fortunate in every respect."
