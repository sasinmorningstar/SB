            "text": "The stringent laws of natureunder the order of the Supreme Personality of Godheadcannot be altered by any living entity. The living entities are eternally under the subjugation of the almighty Lord. The Lord makes all the laws and ordersand these laws and orders are generally called dharma or religion. No one can create any religious formula. Bona fide religion is to abide by the orders of the Lord. The Lord's orders are clearly declared in the Bhagavad-gītā. Everyone should follow Him only or His ordersand that will make all happyboth materially and spiritually. As long as we are in the material worldour duty is to follow the orders of the Lordand if by the grace of the Lord we are liberated from the clutches of the material worldthen in our liberated stage also we can render transcendental loving service unto the Lord. In our material stage we can see neither ourselves nor the Lord for want of spiritual vision. But when we are liberated from material affection and are situated in our original spiritual form we can see both ourselves and the Lord face to face. Mukti means to be reinstated in one's original spiritual status after giving up the material conception of life. Thereforehuman life is specifically meant for qualifying ourselves for this spiritual liberty. Unfortunatelyunder the influence of illusory material energywe accept this spot-life of only a few years as our permanent existence and thus become illusioned by possessing so-called countryhomelandchildrenwifecommunitywealthetc.which are false representations created by māyā (illusion). And under the dictation of māyāwe fight with one another to protect these false possessions. By cultivating spiritual knowledgewe can realize that we have nothing to do with all this material paraphernalia. Then at once we become free from material attachment. This clearance of the misgivings of material existence at once takes place by association with the Lord's devoteeswho are able to inject the transcendental sound into the depths of the bewildered heart and thus make one practically liberated from all lamentation and illusion. That is a summary of the pacifying measures for those affected by the reaction of stringent material lawsexhibited in the forms of birthdeathold age and diseasewhich are insoluble factors of material existence. The victims of warnamelythe family members of the Kuruswere lamenting the problems of deathand the Lord pacified them on the basis of knowledge."
