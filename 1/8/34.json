Without spiritual contactmatter cannot create. This principle was followed from the very beginning of the creation. The Supreme Spirit entered the universeand the first living beingBrahmāwas born on a lotus flower grown out of the transcendental abdomen of Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu is therefore known as Padmanābha. Brahmā is known as ātma-bhū because he was begotten directly from the father without any contact of mother Lakṣmījī. Lakṣmījī was present near Nārāyaṇaengaged in the service of the Lordand stillwithout contact with LakṣmījīNārāyaṇa begot Brahmā. That is the omnipotency of the Lord. One who foolishly considers Nārāyaṇa like other living beings should take a lesson from this. Nārāyaṇa is not an ordinary living being. He is the Personality of Godhead Himselfand He has all the potencies of all the senses in all parts of His transcendental body. An ordinary living being begets a child by sexual intercourseand he has no other means to beget a child other than the one designed for him. But Nārāyaṇabeing omnipotentis not bound to any condition of energy. He is complete and independent to do anything and everything by His various potenciesvery easily and perfectly. Brahmā is therefore directly the son of the father and was not put into the womb of a mother. Therefore he is known as ātma-bhū. This Brahmā is in charge of further creations in the universesecondarily reflected by the potency of the Omnipotent. Within the halo of the universe there is a transcendental planet known as Śvetadvīpawhich is the abode of the Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇuthe Paramātmā feature of the Supreme Lord. Whenever there is trouble in the universe that cannot be solved by the administrative demigodsthey approach Brahmājī for a solutionand if it is not to be solved even by Brahmājīthen Brahmājī consults and prays to the Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu for an incarnation and solution to the problems. Such a problem arose when Kaṁsa and others were ruling over the earth and the earth became too much overburdened by the misdeeds of the asuras. Brahmājīalong with other demigodsprayed at the shore of the Kṣīrodaka Oceanand they were advised of the descent of Kṛṣṇa as the son of Vasudeva and Devakī. So some people say that the Lord appeared because of the prayers of Brahmājī."
