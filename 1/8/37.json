            "text": "The Pāṇḍavas are most fortunate because with all good luck they were entirely dependent on the mercy of the Lord. In the material worldto be dependent on the mercy of someone else is the utmost sign of misfortunebut in the case of our transcendental relation with the Lordit is the most fortunate case when we can live completely dependent on Him. The material disease is due to thinking of becoming independent of everything. But the cruel material nature does not allow us to become independent. The false attempt to become independent of the stringent laws of nature is known as material advancement of experimental knowledge. The whole material world is moving on this false attempt of becoming independent of the laws of nature. Beginning from Rāvaṇawho wanted to prepare a direct staircase to the planets of heavendown to the present agethey are trying to overcome the laws of nature. They are trying now to approach distant planetary systems by electronic mechanical power. But the highest goal of human civilization is to work hard under the guidance of the Lord and become completely dependent on Him. The highest achievement of perfect civilization is to work with valor but at the same time depend completely on the Lord. The Pāṇḍavas were the ideal executors of this standard of civilization. Undoubtedly they were completely dependent on the good will of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇabut they were not idle parasites of the Lord. They were all highly qualified both by personal character and by physical activities. Still they always looked for the mercy of the Lord because they knew that every living being is dependent by constitutional position. The perfection of life isthereforeto become dependent on the will of the Lordinstead of becoming falsely independent in the material world. Those who try to become falsely independent of the Lord are called anāthaor without any guardianwhereas those who are completely dependent on the will of the Lord are called sanāthaor those having someone to protect them. Therefore we must try to be sanātha so that we can always be protected from the unfavorable condition of material existence. By the deluding power of the external material nature we forget that the material condition of life is the most undesirable perplexity. The Bhagavad-gītā therefore directs us (7.19) that after manymany births one fortunate person becomes aware of the fact that Vāsudeva is all in all and that the best way of leading one's life is to surrender unto Him completely. That is the sign of a mahātmā. All the members of the Pāṇḍava family were mahātmās in household life. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was the head of these mahātmāsand Queen Kuntīdevī was the mother. The lessons of the Bhagavad-gītā and all the Purāṇasspecifically the Bhāgavata Purāṇaare therefore inevitably connected with the history of the Pāṇḍava mahātmās. For themseparation from the Lord was just like the separation of a fish from water. Śrīmatī Kuntīdevīthereforefelt such separation like a thunderboltand the whole prayer of the Queen is to try to persuade the Lord to stay with them. After the Battle of Kurukṣetraalthough the inimical kings were killedtheir sons and grandsons were still there to deal with the Pāṇḍavas. It is not only the Pāṇḍavas who were put into the condition of enmitybut all of us are always in such a conditionand the best way of living is to become completely dependent on the will of the Lord and thereby overcome all difficulties of material existence."
