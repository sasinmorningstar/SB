No one can manufacture a new path of religionas is the fashion for certain ambitious persons. The factual way of religion is to accept the Lord as the supreme authority and thus render service unto Him in spontaneous love. A living being cannot help but render service because he is constitutionally made for that purpose. The only function of the living being is to render service to the Lord. The Lord is greatand living beings are subordinate to Him. Thereforethe duty of the living being is just to serve Him only. Unfortunately the illusioned living beingsout of misunderstanding onlybecome servants of the senses by material desire. This desire is called avidyāor nescience. And out of such desire the living being makes different plans for material enjoyment centered about a perverted sex life. He therefore becomes entangled in the chain of birth and death by transmigrating into different bodies on different planets under the direction of the Supreme Lord. Unlessthereforeone is beyond the boundary of this nescienceone cannot get free from the threefold miseries of material life. That is the law of nature."
