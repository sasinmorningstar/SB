            "text": "This is something like the preface to the performances of Aśvamedha-yajña by Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. The comparison of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to the King of heaven is significant. The King of heaven is thousands and thousands of times greater than Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira in opulenceyet the fame of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was not less. The reason is that Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was a pure devotee of the Lordand by His grace only was King Yudhiṣṭhira on the level of the King of heaveneven though he performed only three yajñas whereas the King of heaven performed hundreds. That is the prerogative of the devotee of the Lord. The Lord is equal to everyonebut a devotee of the Lord is more glorified because he is always in touch with the all-great. The sun rays are equally distributedbut still there are some places which are always dark. This is not due to the sun but to the receptive power. Similarlythose who are cent percent devotees of the Lord get the full-fledged mercy of the Lordwhich is always equally distributed everywhere."
