A man who sees knows well that the living entity is neither the body nor the mindbut is transcendental to the material conception of life. The common man thinks of violence and nonviolence in terms of the bodybut that is a kind of delusion. Everyone is duty-bound according to one's occupational duties. A kṣatriya is bound to fight for the right causeregardless of the opposite party. In such discharge of dutyone should not be disturbed by annihilation of the material bodywhich is only an external dress of the living soul. All this was perfectly known to Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhirabut by the will of the Lord he became just like a common man because there was another great idea behind this delusion: the King would be instructed by Bhīṣma as Arjuna was instructed by the Lord Himself."
