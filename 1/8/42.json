To cut off the tie of all other affections does not mean complete negation of the finer elementslike affection for someone else. This is not possible. A living beingwhoever he may bemust have this feeling of affection for others because this is a symptom of life. The symptoms of lifesuch as desireangerhankeringsfeelings of attractionetc.cannot be annihilated. Only the objective has to be changed. Desire cannot be negatedbut in devotional service the desire is changed only for the service of the Lord in place of desire for sense gratification. The so-called affection for familysocietycountryetc.consists of different phases of sense gratification. When this desire is changed for the satisfaction of the Lordit is called devotional service."

But when he heard the message of the LordŚrīmad Bhagavad-gītāhe changed his decision and served the Lord. And for his doing sohe became a famous devotee of the Lordfor it is declared in all the scriptures that Arjuna attained spiritual perfection by devotional service to the Lord in friendship. The fighting was therethe friendship was thereArjuna was thereand Kṛṣṇa was therebut Arjuna became a different person by devotional service. Thereforethe prayers of Kuntī also indicate the same categorical changes in activities. Śrīmatī Kuntī wanted to serve the Lord without diversionand that was her prayer. This unalloyed devotion is the ultimate goal of life. Our attention is usually diverted to the service of something which is nongodly or not in the program of the Lord. When the program is changed into the service of the Lordthat is to say when the senses are purified in relation with the service of the Lordit is called pure unalloyed devotional service. Śrīmatī Kuntīdevī wanted that perfection and prayed for it from the Lord."

            "text": "Her affection for the Pāṇḍavas and the Vṛṣṇis is not out of the range of devotional service because the service of the Lord and the service of the devotees are identical. Sometimes service to the devotee is more valuable than service to the Lord. But here the affection of Kuntīdevī for the Pāṇḍavas and the Vṛṣṇis was due to family relation. This tie of affection in terms of material relation is the relation of māyā because the relations of the body or the mind are due to the influence of the external energy. Relations of the soulestablished in relation with the Supreme Soulare factual relations. When Kuntīdevī wanted to cut off the family relationshe meant to cut off the relation of the skin. The skin relation is the cause of material bondagebut the relation of the soul is the cause of freedom. This relation of the soul to the soul can be established by the via medium of the relation with the Supersoul. Seeing in the darkness is not seeing. But seeing by the light of the sun means to see the sun and everything else which was unseen in the darkness. That is the way of devotional service."
