The conditioned soulswho are engaged in trying to lord it over the material worldare also enchanted by His mystic powersbut His devotees are enchanted in a different way by the glories of the Lordand His merciful blessings are upon them. His energy is displayed in different waysas electrical energy works in manifold capacities. Śrīmatī Kuntīdevī has prayed to the Lord just to enunciate a fragment of His glories. All His devotees worship Him in that wayby chosen wordsand therefore the Lord is known as Uttamaśloka. No amount of chosen words is sufficient to enumerate the Lord's gloryand yet He is satisfied by such prayers as the father is satisfied even by the broken linguistic attempts of the growing child. The word māyā is used both in the sense of delusion and mercy. Herein the word māyā is used in the sense of the Lord's mercy upon Kuntīdevī."
