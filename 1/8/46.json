Duryodhana was there on the throneand he was doing well in his administrationand in one sense there was no need of fighting. But on the principle of justice Yudhiṣṭhira was to replace him. The whole clique of politics centered around this pointand all the kings and residents of the whole world became involved in this fight between the rival brothers. Lord Kṛṣṇa was also there on the side of King Yudhiṣṭhira. It is said in the MahābhārataAdi-parva (20) that 640,000,000 men were killed in the eighteen days of the Battle of Kurukṣetraand some hundreds of thousands were missing. Practically this was the greatest battle in the world within five thousand years."

            "text": "This mass killing simply to enthrone Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was too mortifyingso he tried to be convinced with evidences from histories by great sages like Vyāsa and the Lord Himself that the fight was just because the cause was just. But Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira would not be satisfiedeven though he was instructed by the greatest personalities of the time. Kṛṣṇa is designated herein as the performer of superhuman actionsbut in this particular instance neither He nor Vyāsa could convince King Yudhiṣṭhira. Does it mean that He failed to be a superhuman actor? Nocertainly not. The interpretation is that the Lord as īśvaraor the Supersoul in the hearts of both King Yudhiṣṭhira and Vyāsaperformed still more superhuman action because the Lord desired it. As Supersoul of King YudhiṣṭhiraHe did not allow the King to be convinced by the words of Vyāsa and othersincluding Himselfbecause He desired that the King hear instructions from the dying Bhīṣmadevawho was another great devotee of the Lord. The Lord wanted that at the last stage of his material existence the great warrior Bhīṣmadeva see Him personally and see his beloved grandchildrenKing Yudhiṣṭhiraetc.now situated on the throneand thus pass away very peacefully. Bhīṣmadeva was not at all satisfied to fight against the Pāṇḍavaswho were his beloved fatherless grandchildren. But the kṣatriyas are also very stern peopleand therefore he was obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because he was maintained at the expense of Duryodhana. Besides thisthe Lord also desired that King Yudhiṣṭhira be pacified by the words of Bhīṣmadeva so that the world could see that Bhīṣmadeva excelled all in knowledgeincluding the Lord Himself."
