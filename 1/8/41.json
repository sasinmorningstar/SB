But the householders are sometimes obliged to ask favors from the Lordbeing bound by the tie of family affection. Śrīmatī Kuntīdevī was conscious of this factand therefore she prayed to the Lord to cut off the affectionate tie from her own kinsmenthe Pāṇḍavas and the Vṛṣṇis. The Pāṇḍavas are her own sonsand the Vṛṣṇis are the members of her paternal family. Kṛṣṇa was equally related to both the families. Both the families required the Lord's help because both were dependent devotees of the Lord. Śrīmatī Kuntīdevī wished Śrī Kṛṣṇa to remain with her sons the Pāṇḍavasbut by His doing so her paternal house would be bereft of the benefit. All these partialities troubled the mind of Kuntīand therefore she desired to cut off the affectionate tie."

The typical example is the band of six Gosvāmīswho followed the path of Lord Caitanya. All of them belonged to the most enlightened and cultured rich families of the higher castesbut for the benefit of the mass of population they left their comfortable homes and became mendicants. To cut off all family affection means to broaden the field of activities. Without doing thisno one can be qualified as a brāhmaṇaa kinga public leader or a devotee of the Lord. The Personality of Godheadas an ideal kingshowed this by example. Śrī Rāmacandra cut off the tie of affection for His beloved wife to manifest the qualities of an ideal king."

Śrīmatī Kuntīdevī was conscious of this factand being weak she prayed to be free from such bondage of family affection. The Lord is addressed as the Lord of the universeor the Lord of the universal mindindicating His all-powerful ability to cut the hard knot of family affection. Thereforeit is sometimes experienced that the Lordout of His special affinity towards a weak devoteebreaks the family affection by force of circumstances arranged by His all-powerful energy. By doing so He causes the devotee to become completely dependent on Him and thus clears the path for his going back to Godhead."
