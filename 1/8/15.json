In other wordsthe glowing effulgence known as brahma-tejas is nothing but the rays of the Lordjust as the sun rays are rays of the sun disc. So this Brahma weapon alsoalthough materially irresistiblecould not surpass the supreme strength of the Lord. The weapon called brahmāstrareleased by Aśvatthāmāwas neutralized and foiled by Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa by His own energy; that is to sayHe did not wait for any other's help because He is absolute."
