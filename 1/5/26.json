            "text": "Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇathe Absolute Personality of Godheadis attractive not only in His personal featuresbut also in His transcendental activities. It is so because the Absolute is absolute by His namefameformpastimesentourageparaphernaliaetc. The Lord descends on this material world out of His causeless mercy and displays His various transcendental pastimes as a human being so that human beings attracted towards Him become able to go back to Godhead. Men are naturally apt to hear histories and narrations of various personalities performing mundane activitieswithout knowing that by such association one simply wastes valuable time and also becomes addicted to the three qualities of mundane nature. Instead of wasting timeone can get spiritual success by turning his attention to the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. By hearing the narration of the pastimes of the Lordone contacts directly the Personality of Godheadandas explained beforeby hearing about the Personality of Godheadfrom withinall accumulated sins of the mundane creature are cleared. Thus being cleared of all sinsthe hearer gradually becomes liberated from mundane association and becomes attracted to the features of the Lord. Nārada Muni has just explained this by his personal experience. The whole idea is that simply by hearing about the Lord's pastimes one can become one of the associates of the Lord. Nārada Muni has eternal lifeunlimited knowledge and unfathomed blissand he can travel all over the material and spiritual worlds without restriction. One can attain to the highest perfection of life simply by attentive hearing of the transcendental pastimes of the Lord from the right sourcesas Śrī Nārada heard them from the pure devotees (bhakti-vedāntas) in his previous life. This process of hearing in the association of the devotees is especially recommended in this age of quarrel (Kali)."
