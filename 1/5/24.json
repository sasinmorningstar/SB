            "text": "In the Bhagavad-gītā the Lord says\"All the Vedas are searching after Me.\" Lord Śrī Caitanya says that in the Vedas the subject matters are only threenamely to establish the relation of the living entities with the Personality of Godheadperform the relative duties in devotional service and thus achieve the ultimate goalback to Godhead. As suchvedānta-vādīsor the followers of the Vedāntaindicate the pure devotees of the Personality of Godhead. Such vedānta-vādīsor the bhakti-vedāntasare impartial in distributing the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. To them no one is enemy or friend; no one is educated or uneducated. No one is especially favorableand no one is unfavorable. The bhakti-vedāntas see that the people in general are wasting time in false sensuous things. Their business is to get the ignorant mass of people to reestablish their lost relationship with the Personality of Godhead. By such endeavoreven the most forgotten soul is roused up to the sense of spiritual lifeand thus being initiated by the bhakti-vedāntasthe people in general gradually progress on the path of transcendental realization. So the vedānta-vādīs initiated the boy even before he became self-controlled and was detached from childish sportingetc. But before the initiationhe (the boy) became more and more advanced in disciplinewhich is very essential for one who wishes to make progress in the line. In the system of varṇāśrama-dharmawhich is the beginning of actual human lifesmall boys after five years of age are sent to become brahmacārī at the guru's āśramawhere these things are systematically taught to boysbe they king's sons or sons of ordinary citizens. The training was compulsory not only to create good citizens of the statebut also to prepare the boy's future life for spiritual realization. The irresponsible life of sense enjoyment was unknown to the children of the followers of the varṇāśrama system. The boy was even injected with spiritual acumen before being placed by the father in the womb of the mother. Both the father and the mother were responsible for the boy's success in being liberated from the material bondage. That is the process of successful family planning. It is to beget children for complete perfection. Without being self-controlledwithout being disciplined and without being fully obedientno one can become successful in following the instructions of the spiritual masterand without doing sono one is able to go back to Godhead."
