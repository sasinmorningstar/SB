Nāradajī has therefore explained the nature of unalloyed devotional service by his personal experience in the development of intimacy between the Lord and the living entity by a gradual process of progressive devotional activities. Such a progressive march of transcendental devotion for the Lord culminates in the attainment of loving service of the Lordwhich is called premā in different transcendental variegatedness called rasas (tastes). Such devotional service is also executed in mixed formsnamely mixed with fruitive work or empiric philosophical speculations."

And this mantra is addressed to the four Deitiesor the Lord with His plenary expansions. The central figure is Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because the plenary portions are His aides-de-camp. The most confidential part of the instruction is that one should always chant and remember the glories of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇathe Supreme Personality of Godheadalong with His different plenary portions expanded as VāsudevaSaṅkarṣaṇaPradyumna and Aniruddha. Those expansions are the original Deities for all other truthsnamely either viṣṇu-tattva or śakti-tattvas."
