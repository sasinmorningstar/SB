There are four classes of good menand there are four classes of bad men also. The four classes of good men acknowledge the authority of the Almighty Godand therefore such good men (1) when they are in difficulty(2) when they are in need of money(3) when they are advanced in knowledge and (4) when they are inquisitive to know more and more about Godintuitively take shelter of the Lord. As suchNāradajī advises Vyāsadeva to broadcast the transcendental knowledge of God in terms of the vast Vedic knowledge which he had already attained."
