The Lord has expanded Himself as living beings in order to accept loving service from themand this alone can satisfy both the Lord and the living beings. Such a scholar as Vyāsadeva has completed many expansions of the Vedic literaturesending with the Vedānta philosophybut none of them have been written directly glorifying the Personality of Godhead. Dry philosophical speculations even on the transcendental subject of the Absolute have very little attraction without directly dealing with the glorification of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead is the last word in transcendental realization. The Absolute realized as impersonal Brahman or localized SupersoulParamātmāis less productive of transcendental bliss than the supreme personal realization of His glories."

So what sort of transcendental bliss can be derived by the readers and listeners of Vedānta which is not explained directly by Vyāsadevathe author? Herein arises the necessity of explaining Vedānta-sūtra in the form of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam by the self-same author."
