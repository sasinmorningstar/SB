            "text": "For a pure devoteethe conception of MukundaLord Śrī Kṛṣṇais both personal and impersonal. The impersonal cosmic situation is also Mukunda because it is the emanation of the energy of Mukunda. For examplea tree is a complete unitwhereas the leaves and the branches of the tree are emanated parts and parcels of the tree. The leaves and branches of the tree are also the treebut the tree itself is neither the leaves nor the branches. The Vedic version that the whole cosmic creation is nothing but Brahman means that since everything is emanating from the Supreme Brahmannothing is apart from Him. Similarlythe part-and-parcel hands and legs are called the bodybut the body as the whole unit is neither the hands nor the legs. The Lord is the transcendental form of eternitycognition and beauty. And thus the creation of the energy of the Lord appears to be partially eternalfull of knowledge and beautiful also. The captivated conditioned souls under the influence of the external energymāyāare therefore entrapped in the network of the material nature. They accept this as all in allfor they have no information of the Lord who is the primeval cause. Nor have they information that the parts and parcels of the bodybeing detached from the whole bodyare no longer the same hand or leg as when attached to the body. Similarlya godless civilization detached from the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is just like a detached hand or leg. Such parts and parcels may appear like hands and legsbut they have no efficiency. The devotee of the LordŚrīla Vyāsadevaknows this very well. He is further advised by Śrīla Nārada to expand the idea so that the entrapped conditioned souls may take lessons from him to understand the Supreme Lord as the primeval cause."

            "text": "According to the Vedic versionthe Lord is naturally fully powerfuland thus His supreme energies are always perfect and identical with Him. Both the spiritual and the material skies and their paraphernalia are emanations of the internal and external energies of the Lord. External energy is comparatively inferiorwhereas the internal potency is superior. The superior energy is living forceand therefore she is completely identicalbut the external energybeing inertis partially identical. But both the energies are neither equal to nor greater than the Lordwho is the generator of all energies; such energies are always under His controlexactly as electrical energyhowever powerful it may beis always under the control of the engineer."

            "text": "The human being and all other living beings are products of His internal energies. Thus the living being is also identical with the Lord. But he is never equal or superior to the Personality of Godhead. The Lord and living beings are all individual persons. With the help of the material energies the living beings are also creating somethingbut none of their creations are equal or superior to the creations of the Lord. The human being may create a small playful sputnik and may throw it into outer spacebut that does not mean that he can create a planet like the earth or moon and float it in the air as the Lord does. Men with a poor fund of knowledge claim to be equal to the Lord. They are never equal to the Lord. This is never to be. The human beingafter attaining complete perfectionmay achieve a large percentage of the qualities of the Lord (say up to seventy-eight percent)but it is never possible to surpass the Lord or to become equal with Him. In a diseased condition onlythe foolish being claims to be one with the Lord and thus becomes misled by the illusory energy. The misguided living beingsthereforemust accept the supremacy of the Lord and agree to render loving service to Him. For this they have been created. Without thisthere cannot be any peace or tranquillity in the world. Śrīla Vyāsadeva is advised by Śrīla Nārada to expand this idea in the Bhāgavatam. In the Bhagavad-gītā also the same idea is explained: surrender fully unto the lotus feet of the Lord. That is the only business of the perfect human being."
