Such a devotee of the Lord in full perfection of devotional service is also perfect by the qualification of the Personality of Godhead. As suchthe eightfold perfections of mystic power (aṣṭa-siddhi) constitute very little of his godly opulence. A devotee like Nārada can act wonderfully by his spiritual perfectionwhich every individual is trying to attain. Śrīla Nārada is a cent-percent perfect living beingalthough not equal to the Personality of Godhead."
