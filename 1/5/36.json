In every sphere of life the Lord should be situated as the proprietor. According to the Vedic riteseven in the worship of some demigods like IndraBrahmāSarasvatī and Gaṇeśathe system is that in all circumstances the representation of Viṣṇu must be there as yajñeśvaraor the controlling power of such sacrifices. It is recommended that a particular demigod be worshiped for a particular purposebut still the presence of Viṣṇu is compulsory in order to make the function proper."

In the Bhagavad-gītā the Lord has declared Himself to be the supreme enjoyer of everythingthe supreme proprietor of every planet and the supreme friend of all beings. No one else but Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa can claim to be the proprietor of everything within His creation. A pure devotee remembers this constantlyand in doing so he repeats the transcendental namefame and qualities of the Lordwhich means that he is constantly in touch with the Lord. The Lord is identical with His namefameetc.and therefore to be associated with His namefameetc.constantlymeans actually to associate with the Lord."

Not only should we give the profit of our earning to this causebut we must also arrange to preach this cult of devotion to others because that is also one of the orders of the Lord. The Lord definitely says that no one is more dear to Him than one who is always engaged in the preaching work of the Lord's name and fame all over the world. The scientific discoveries of the material world can also be equally engaged in carrying out His order. He wants the message of the Bhagavad-gītā to be preached amongst His devotees. It may not be so done amongst those who have no credit of austeritiescharityeducationetc. Thereforethe attempt must go on to convert unwilling men to become His devotees. Lord Caitanya has taught a very simple method in this connection. He has taught the lesson for preaching the transcendental message through singingdancing and refreshment. As suchfifty percent of our income may be spent for this purpose. In this fallen age of quarrel and dissensionif only the leading and wealthy persons of society agree to spend fifty percent of their income in the service of the Lordas it is taught by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhuthere is absolute certainty of converting this hell of pandemonium to the transcendental abode of the Lord. No one will disagree to partake in a function where good singingdancing and refreshment are administered. Everyone will attend such a functionand everyone is sure to feel individually the transcendental presence of the Lord. This alone will help the attendant associate with the Lord and thereby purify himself in spiritual realization. The only condition for successfully executing such spiritual activities is that they must be conducted under the guidance of a pure devotee who is completely free from all mundane desiresfruitive activities and dry speculations about the nature of the Lord. No one has to discover the nature of the Lord. It is already spoken by the Lord Himself in the Bhagavad-gītā especially and in all other Vedic literatures generally. We have simply to accept them in toto and abide by the orders of the Lord. That will guide us to the path of perfection. One can remain in his own position. No one has to change his positionespecially in this age of variegated difficulties. The only condition is that one must give up the habit of dry speculation aimed at becoming one with the Lord. And after giving up such lofty puffed-up vanitiesone may very submissively receive the orders of the Lord in the Bhagavad-gītā or Bhāgavatam from the lips of a bona fide devotee whose qualification is mentioned above. That will make everything successfulwithout a doubt."
