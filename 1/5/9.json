The root cause of the despondency of Vyāsadeva was his deliberate avoidance of glorifying the Lord in his various editions of the Purāṇas. He has certainlyas a matter of coursegiven descriptions of the glories of the Lord (Śrī Kṛṣṇa) but not as many as given to religiosityeconomic developmentsense gratification and salvation. These four items are by far inferior to engagement in the devotional service of the Lord. Śrī Vyāsadevaas the authorized scholarknew very well this difference. And still instead of giving more importance to the better type of engagementnamelydevotional service to the Lordhe had more or less improperly used his valuable timeand thus he was despondent. From this it is clearly indicated that no one can be pleased substantially without being engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Bhagavad-gītā this fact is clearly mentioned."

This is called the stage of self-realizationor the brahma-bhūta stage . After attainment of this brahma-bhūta stageone is satisfied. But satisfaction is the beginning of transcendental bliss. One should progress by attaining neutrality and equality in the relative world. And passing this stage of equanimityone is fixed in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. This is the instruction of the Personality of Godhead in the Bhagavad-gītā. The conclusion is that in order to maintain the status quo of the brahma-bhūta stageas also to increase the degree of transcendental realizationNārada recommended to Vyāsadeva that he (Vyāsadeva) should now eagerly and repeatedly describe the path of devotional service. This would cure him from gross despondency."
