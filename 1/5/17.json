    "translation": "\nOne who has forsaken his material occupations to engage in the devotional service of the Lord may sometimes fall down while in an immature stage, yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful.

            "text": "As far as the duties of mankind are concernedthere are innumerable duties. Every man is duty-bound not only to his parentsfamily memberssocietycountryhumanityother living beingsthe demigodsetc.but also to the great philosopherspoetsscientistsetc. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one can relinquish all such duties and surrender unto the service of the Lord. So if one does so and becomes successful in the discharge of his devotional service unto the Lordit is well and good. But it so happens sometimes that one surrenders himself unto the service of the Lord by some temporary sentimentand in the long rundue to so many other reasonshe falls down from the path of service by undesirable association. There are so many instances of this in the histories. Bharata Mahārāja was obliged to take his birth as a stag due to his intimate attachment to a stag. He thought of this stag when he died. As suchin the next birth he became a stagalthough he did not forget the incident of his previous birth. SimilarlyCitraketu also fell down due to his offenses at the feet of Śiva. But in spite of all thisthe stress is given here to surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Lordeven if there is a chance of falling downbecause even though one falls down from the prescribed duties of devotional servicehe will never forget the lotus feet of the Lord. Once engaged in the devotional service of the Lordone will continue the service in all circumstances. In the Bhagavad-gītā it is said that even a small quantity of devotional service can save one from the most dangerous position. There are many instances of such examples in history. Ajāmila is one of them. Ajāmila in his early life was a devoteebut in his youth he fell down. Still he was saved by the Lord at the end."
