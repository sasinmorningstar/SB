            "text": "The general and popular notion is that by discharging fruitive work in terms of the direction of the scriptures one becomes perfectly able to acquire transcendental knowledge for spiritual realization. Bhakti-yoga is considered by some to be another form of karma. But factually bhakti-yoga is above both karma and jñāna. Bhakti-yoga is independent of jñāna or karma; on the other handjñāna and karma are dependent on bhakti-yoga. This kriyā-yoga or karma-yogaas recommended by Śrī Nārada to Vyāsais specifically recommended because the principle is to satisfy the Lord. The Lord does not want His sonsthe living beingsto suffer the threefold miseries of life. He desires that all of them come to Him and live with Himbut going back to Godhead means that one must purify himself from material infections. When work is performedthereforeto satisfy the Lordthe performer becomes gradually purified from the material affection. This purification means attainment of spiritual knowledge. Therefore knowledge is dependent on karmaor workdone on behalf of the Lord. Other knowledgebeing devoid of bhakti-yoga or satisfaction of the Lordcannot lead one back to the kingdom of Godwhich means that it cannot even offer salvationas already explained in connection with the stanza naiṣkarmyam apy acyuta-bhāva-varjitam . The conclusion is that a devotee engaged in the unalloyed service of the Lordspecifically in hearing and chanting of His transcendental gloriesbecomes simultaneously spiritually enlightened by the divine graceas confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā."
