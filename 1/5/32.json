            "text": "Śrī Nārada Muni personally experienced that the most feasible and practical way to open the path of salvation or get relief from all miseries of life is to hear submissively the transcendental activities of the Lord from the right and bona fide sources. This is the only remedial process. The entire material existence is full of miseries. Foolish people have manufacturedout of their tiny brainsmany remedial measures for removing the threefold miseries pertaining to the body and mindpertaining to the natural disturbances and in relation with other living beings. The whole world is struggling very hard to exist out of these miseriesbut men do not know that without the sanction of the Lord no plan or no remedial measure can actually bring about the desired peace and tranquillity. The remedial measure to cure a patient by medical treatment is useless if it is not sanctioned by the Lord. To cross the river or the ocean by a suitable boat is no remedial measure if it is not sanctioned by the Lord. We should know for certain that the Lord is the ultimate sanctioning officerand we must therefore dedicate our attempts to the mercy of the Lord for ultimate success or to get rid of the obstacles on the path of success. The Lord is all-pervadingall-powerfulomniscient and omnipresent. He is the ultimate sanctioning agent of all good or bad effects. We shouldthereforelearn to dedicate our activities unto the mercy of the Lord and accept Him either as impersonal Brahmanlocalized Paramātmā or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It does not matter what one is. One must dedicate everything in the service of the Lord. If one is a learned scholarscientistphilosopherpoetetc.then he should employ his learning to establish the supremacy of the Lord. Try to study the energy of the Lord in every sphere of life. Do not decry Him and try to become like Him or take His position simply by fragmental accumulation of knowledge. If one is an administratorstatesmanwarriorpoliticianetc.then one should try to establish the Lord's supremacy in statesmanship. Fight for the cause of the Lord as Śrī Arjuna did. In the beginningŚrī Arjunathe great fighterdeclined to fightbut when he was convinced by the Lord that the fighting was necessaryŚrī Arjuna changed his decision and fought for His cause. Similarlyif one is a businessmanan industrialistan agriculturistetc.then one should spend his hard-earned money for the cause of the Lord. Think always that the money which is accumulated is the wealth of the Lord. Wealth is considered to be the goddess of fortune (Lakṣmī)and the Lord is Nārāyaṇaor the husband of Lakṣmī. Try to engage Lakṣmī in the service of Lord Nārāyaṇa and be happy. That is the way to realize the Lord in every sphere of life. The best thing isafter allto get relief from all material activities and engage oneself completely in hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. But in case of the absence of such an opportunityone should try to engage in the service of the Lord everything for which one has specific attractionand that is the way of peace and prosperity. The word saṁsūcitam in this stanza is also significant. One should not think for a moment that the realization of Nārada was childish imagination only. It is not like that. It is so realized by the expert and erudite scholarsand that is the real import of the word saṁsūcitam."
