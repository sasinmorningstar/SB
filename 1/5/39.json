It is a completely perfect method for approaching the Lord. By such pure contact with the Lordwithout offense of material conceptions (numbering ten)the devotee can rise above the material plane to understand the inner meaning of the Vedic literaturesincluding the Lord's existence in the transcendental realm. The Lord reveals His identity gradually to one who has unflinching faithboth in the spiritual master and in the Lord. After thisthe devotee is endowed with mystic opulenceswhich are eight in number. And above allthe devotee is accepted in the confidential entourage of the Lord and is entrusted with specific service of the Lord through the agency of the spiritual master. A pure devotee is more interested in serving the Lord than in showing an exhibition of the mystic powers dormant in him. Śrī Nārada has explained all these from his personal experienceand one can obtain all the facilities which Śrī Nārada obtained by perfecting the chanting process of the sound representation of the Lord. There is no bar for chanting this transcendental sound by anyoneprovided it is received through Nārada's representativecoming down by the chain of disciplic successionor the paramparā system."
