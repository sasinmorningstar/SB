    "translation": "\nO great sage, as soon as I got a taste for the Personality of Godhead, my attention to hear of the Lord was unflinching. And as my taste developed, I could realize that it was only in my ignorance that I had accepted gross and subtle coverings, for both the Lord and I are transcendental.\n\n",

            "text": "Ignorance in material existence is compared to darknessand in all Vedic literatures the Personality of Godhead is compared to the sun. Wherever there is light there cannot be darkness. Hearing of the Lord's pastimes is itself transcendental association with the Lord because there is no difference between the Lord and His transcendental pastimes. To become associated with the supreme light is to dissipate all ignorance. By ignorance onlythe conditioned soul wrongly thinks that both he and the Lord are products of material nature. But in fact the Personality of Godhead and the living beings are transcendentaland they have nothing to do with the material nature. When ignorance is removed and it is perfectly realized that there is nothing existing without the Personality of Godheadthen nescience is removed. Since the gross and subtle bodies are emanations from the Personality of Godheadthe knowledge of light permits one to engage both of them in the service of the Lord. The gross body should be engaged in acts of rendering service to the Lord (as in bringing watercleansing the temple or making obeisancesetc.). The path of arcanāor worshiping the Lord in the templeinvolves engaging one's gross body in the service of the Lord. Similarlythe subtle mind should be engaged in hearing the transcendental pastimes of the Lordthinking about themchanting His nameetc. All such activities are transcendental. None of the gross or subtle senses should otherwise be engaged. Such realization of transcendental activities is made possible by manymany years of apprenticeship in the devotional servicebut simply attraction of love for the Personality of Godheadas it was developed in Nārada Muniby hearingis highly effective."
