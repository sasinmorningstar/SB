    "translation": "\nMy dear Vyāsa, even though a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa sometimes falls down somehow or other, he certainly does not undergo material existence like others [fruitive workers, etc.] because a person who has once relished the taste of the lotus feet of the Lord can do nothing but remember that ecstasy again and again.\n\n",

There are certainly many instances where devotees of the Lord have fallen down due to uncongenial associationjust like fruitive workerswho are always prone to degradation. But even though he falls downa devotee is never to be considered the same as a fallen karmī. A karmī suffers the result of his own fruitive reactionswhereas a devotee is reformed by chastisement directed by the Lord Himself. The sufferings of an orphan and the sufferings of a beloved child of a king are not one and the same. An orphan is really poor because he has no one to take care of himbut a beloved son of a rich manalthough he appears to be on the same level as the orphanis always under the vigilance of his capable father. A devotee of the Lorddue to wrong associationsometimes imitates the fruitive workers. The fruitive workers want to lord it over the material world. Similarlya neophyte devotee foolishly thinks of accumulating some material power in exchange for devotional service. Such foolish devotees are sometimes put into difficulty by the Lord Himself. As a special favorHe may remove all material paraphernalia. By such actionthe bewildered devotee is forsaken by all friends and relativesand so he comes to his senses again by the mercy of the Lord and is set right to execute his devotional service."

A devotee in such a position is not as fortunate as one who is chastised by the Lord and put into a position seemingly of helplessness. The devotee who becomes helpless by the will of the Lord is more fortunate than those who are born in good families. The fallen devotees born in a good family may forget the lotus feet of the Lord because they are less fortunatebut the devotee who is put into a forlorn condition is more fortunate because he swiftly returns to the lotus feet of the Lordthinking himself helpless all around."
