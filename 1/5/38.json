He is therefore worshiped by sound representation via the transcendental method of chanting. Anything which is beyond the scope of experience by our imperfect senses can be realized fully by the sound representation. A person transmitting sound from a far distant place can be factually experienced. If this is materially possiblewhy not spiritually? This experience is not a vague impersonal experience. It is actually an experience of the transcendental Personality of Godheadwho possesses the pure form of eternitybliss and knowledge."

            "text": "In the Amarakośa Sanskrit dictionary the word mūrti carries import in twofold meaningsnamelyform and difficulty. Therefore amūrtikam is explained by Ācārya Śrī Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura as meaning \"without difficulty.\" The transcendental form of eternal bliss and knowledge can be experienced by our original spiritual senseswhich can be revived by chanting of the holy mantrasor transcendental sound representations. Such sound should be received from the transparent agency of the bona fide spiritual masterand the chanting may be practiced by the direction of the spiritual master. That will gradually lead us nearer to the Lord. This method of worship is recommended in the pāñcarātrika systemwhich is both recognized and authorized. The pāñcarātrika system has the most authorized codes for transcendental devotional service. Without the help of such codesone cannot approach the Lordcertainly not by dry philosophical speculation. The pāñcarātrika system is both practical and suitable for this age of quarrel. The Pañcarātra is more important than the Vedānta for this modern age."
