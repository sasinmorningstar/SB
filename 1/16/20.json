Since Dharmaor the principles of religionwould be lost in the proportion of three out of fourthe symbolic bull was standing on one leg only. When three fourths of the population of the whole world become irreligiousthe situation is converted into hell for the animals. In the age of Kaligodless civilizations will create so many so-called religious societies in which the Personality of Godhead will be directly or indirectly defied. And thus faithless societies of men will make the world uninhabitable for the saner section of people. There are gradations of human beings in terms of proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The first-class faithful men are the Vaiṣṇavas and the brāhmaṇasthen the kṣatriyasthen the vaiśyasthen the śūdrasthen the mlecchasthe yavanas and at last the caṇḍālas. The degradation of the human instinct begins from the mlecchasand the caṇḍāla state of life is the last word in human degradation. All the above terms mentioned in the Vedic literatures are never meant for any particular community or birth. They are different qualifications of human beings in general. There is no question of birthright or community. One can acquire the respective qualifications by one's own effortsand thus the son of a Vaiṣṇava can become a mlecchaor the son of a caṇḍāla can become more than a brāhmaṇaall in terms of their association and intimate relation with the Supreme Lord."

The system is that living beings live on the produce of grains and vegetablesand by eating such foodstuff they get vital power of the body in the shape of blood and semenand from blood and semen one living being is able to create other living beings. But the production of grainsgrassetc. becomes possible by rainand this rain is made to shower properly by performance of recommended sacrifices. Such sacrifices are directed by the rites of the Vedasnamely SāmaYajurṚg and Atharva. In the Manu-smṛti it is recommended that by offerings of sacrifice on the altar of the firethe sun-god is pleased. When the sun-god is pleasedhe properly collects water from the seaand thus sufficient clouds collect on the horizon and rains fall. After sufficient rains fallthere is sufficient production of grains for men and all animalsand thus there is energy in the living being for progressive activity. The mlecchashowevermake plans to install slaughterhouses for killing bulls and cows along with other animalsthinking that they will prosper by increasing the number of factories and live on animal food without caring for performance of sacrifices and production of grains. But they must know that even for the animals they must produce grass and vegetablesotherwise the animals cannot live. And to produce grass for the animalsthey require sufficient rains. Therefore they have to depend ultimately on the mercy of the demigods like the sun-godIndra and Candraand such demigods must be satisfied by performances of sacrifice."

Thosehoweverwho are consciously engaged in the devotional service of the Lord are transcendental to all varieties of sin and virtue. Their activities are free from the contamination of the three modes of material nature. For the devotees there is no need for performance of prescribed sacrifices because the very life of the devotee is a symbol of sacrifice. But persons who are engaged in fruitive activities for sense enjoyment must perform the prescribed sacrifices because that is the only means to get free from the reaction of all sins committed by fruitive workers. Sacrifice is the means for counteracting such accumulated sins. The demigods are pleased when such sacrifices are performedjust as prison officers are satisfied when the prisoners are turned into obedient subjects. Lord Caitanyahoweverhas recommended only one yajñaor sacrificecalled the saṅkīrtana-yajñathe chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇain which everyone can take part. Thus both devotees and fruitive workers can derive equal benefit from the performances of saṅkīrtana-yajña."
