            "text": "The principles of religion are laid down by the Lord Himselfand the executor of such laws is Dharmarājaor Yamarāja. Such principles work fully in the age of Satya-yuga; in the Tretā-yuga they are reduced by a fraction of one fourth; in the Dvāpara-yuga they are reduced to one halfand in the Kali-yuga they are reduced to one fourthgradually diminishing to the zero pointand then devastation takes place. Happiness in the world depends proportionately on the maintenance of the religious principlesindividually or collectively. The best part of valor is to maintain the principles despite all kinds of odds. Thus one can be happy during the span of life and ultimately return to Godhead."
