            "text": "Even if it were possible to count the atoms after smashing the earth into powderstill it would not be possible to estimate the unfathomable transcendental qualities of the Lord. It is said that Lord Anantadeva has tried to expound the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord with His numberless tonguesand that for numberless years together it has been impossible to estimate the qualities of the Lord. The above statement of the qualities of the Lord is just to estimate His qualities as far as a human being is able to see Him. But even if it is sothe above qualities can be divided into many subheadings. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmīthe third qualityintolerance of another's unhappinesscan be subdivided into (1) protection of the surrendered souls and (2) well wishes for the devotees. In the Bhagavad-gītā the Lord states that He wants every soul to surrender unto Him onlyand He assures everyone that if one does so He will give protection from the reactions of all sins. Unsurrendered souls are not devotees of the Lordand thus there is no particular protection for everyone in general. For the devotees He has all good wishesand for those who are actually engaged in loving transcendental service of the LordHe gives particular attention. He gives direction to such pure devotees to help them discharge their responsibilities on the path back to Godhead. By equality (10)the Lord is equally kind to everyoneas the sun is equal in distributing its rays over everyone. Yet there are many who are unable to take advantage of the sun's rays. Similarlythe Lord says that surrendering unto Him is the guarantee for all protection from Himbut unfortunate persons are unable to accept this propositionand therefore they suffer from all material miseries. So even though the Lord is equally well-wishing to everyonethe unfortunate living beingdue to bad association onlyis unable to accept His instructions in totoand for this the Lord is never to be blamed. He is called the well-wisher for the devotees only. He appears to be partial to His devoteesbut factually the matter rests on the living being to accept or reject equal treatment by the Lord."

The rest is carried on by the Lord without a break."

But still He accepts voluntary responsibilities in displaying different roles in His transcendental pastimes. As a boyHe was playing the part of a cowboy. As the son of Nanda MahārājaHe discharged responsibility perfectly. Similarlywhen He was playing the part of a kṣatriya as the son of Mahārāja VasudevaHe displayed all the skill of a martially spirited kṣatriya. In almost all casesthe kṣatriya king has to secure a wife by fighting or kidnapping. This sort of behavior for a kṣatriya is praiseworthy in the sense that a kṣatriya must show his power of chivalry to his would-be wife so that the daughter of a kṣatriya can see the valor of her would-be husband. Even the Personality of Godhead Śrī Rāma displayed such a spirit of chivalry during His marriage. He broke the strongest bowcalled Haradhanurand achieved the hand of Sītādevīthe mother of all opulence. The kṣatriya spirit is displayed during marriage festivalsand there is nothing wrong in such fighting. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa discharged such responsibility fully because although He had more than sixteen thousand wivesin each and every case He fought like a chivalrous kṣatriya and thus secured a wife. To fight sixteen thousand times to secure sixteen thousand wives is certainly possible only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. SimilarlyHe displayed full responsibility in every action of His different transcendental pastimes."

Only fools are ungrateful to their benefactors. The Lordhoweverdoes not require benefit from anyone besides Himself because He is full in Himself; still He feels benefited by the unalloyed services of His devotees. The Lord feels grateful to His devotees for such unsophisticatedunconditional service and tries to reciprocate it by rendering servicealthough the devotee also has no such desire in his heart. The transcendental service of the Lord is itself a transcendental benefit for the devoteeand therefore the devotee has nothing to expect from the Lord. On the assertion of the Vedic aphorism sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahmawe can understand that the Lordby the omnipresent rays of His effulgencecalled brahmajyotiis all-pervading inside or outside of everythinglike the omnipresent material skyand thus He is also omniscient."

He is knownthereforeas Madana-mohanaor one who attracts the mind of even Cupid. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī Prabhu has scrutinizingly analyzed other transcendental qualities of the Lord and affirms that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead (Parabrahman). He is omnipotent by His inconceivable energiesand therefore He is the Yogeśvaraor the supreme master of all mystic powers. Being the YogeśvaraHis eternal form is spirituala combination of eternitybliss and knowledge. The nondevotee class cannot understand the dynamic nature of His knowledge because they are satisfied to reach up to His eternal form of knowledge. All great souls aspire to be equal in knowledge with Him. This means that all other knowledge is ever insufficientflexible and measurablewhereas the knowledge of the Lord is ever fixed and unfathomable. Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī affirms in the Bhāgavatam that although He was observed by the citizens of Dvārakā every daythey were ever increasingly anxious to see Him again and again. The living beings can appreciate the qualities of the Lord as the ultimate goalbut they cannot attain the status quo of such equality. This material world is a product of the mahat-tattvawhich is a state of the Lord's dreaming condition in His yoga-nidrā mystic slumber in the Causal Oceanand yet the whole creation appears to be a factual presentation of His creation. This means that the Lord's dreaming conditions are also factual manifestations. He can therefore bring everything under His transcendental controland thus whenever and wherever He does appearHe does so in His fullness."

Even in His incarnation of puruṣa-avatāra He is the Lord of the creative energy. The creative material energy is working under His directionas confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā . He is the control switch of the material energyand to control the material energy in the innumerable universesHe is the root cause of innumerable incarnations in all the universes. There are more than five hundred thousand incarnations of Manu in only one universebesides other incarnations in different universes. In the spiritual worldhoweverbeyond the mahat-tattvathere is no question of incarnationsbut there are plenary expansions of the Lord in different Vaikuṇṭhas. The planets in the spiritual sky are at least three times the number of those within the innumerable universes in the mahat-tattva. And all the Nārāyaṇa forms of the Lord are but expansions of His Vāsudeva featureand thus He is VāsudevaNārāyaṇa and Kṛṣṇa simultaneously. He is śrī-kṛṣṇa govinda hare murārehe nātha nārāyaṇa vāsudevaall in one. His qualitiesthereforecannot be counted by anyonehowever great one may be."
