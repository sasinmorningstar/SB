According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī and Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākurathe word used here is nirvāṇa-vilambitānithat which minimizes the value of liberation. To attain nirvāṇaliberationone has to undergo a severe type of tapasyaausteritybut the Lord is so merciful that He incarnates to diminish the burden of the earth. Simply by remembering such activitiesone can defy the pleasure derived from nirvāṇa and reach the transcendental abode of the Lord to associate with Himeternally engaged in His blissful loving service."
