In many statements in Bhāgavatamwe have observed that the demigods from heaven used to visit this earth to attend sacrifices performed by influential kings and emperors. Herein also we find that during the time of the horse sacrifice ceremony of Mahārāja Parīkṣitthe demigods from other planets were visible even to the common mandue to the sacrificial ceremony. The demigods are not generally visible to common menas the Lord is not visible. But as the Lordby His causeless mercydescends to be visible to the common mansimilarly the demigods also become visible to the common man by their own grace. Although celestial beings are not visible to the naked eyes of the inhabitants of this earthit was due to the influence of Mahārāja Parīkṣit that the demigods also agreed to be visible. The kings used to spend lavishly during such sacrificesas a cloud distributes rains. A cloud is nothing but another form of waterorin other wordsthe waters of the earth transform into clouds. Similarlythe charity made by the kings in such sacrifices are but another form of the taxes collected from the citizens. Butas the rains fall down very lavishly and appear to be more than necessarythe charity made by such kings also seems to be more than what the citizen needs. Satisfied citizens will never organize agitation against the kingand thus there was no need in changing the monarchial state."

The spiritual master must be bona fideand one who wants to have self-realization must approach and take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master to achieve real success."
