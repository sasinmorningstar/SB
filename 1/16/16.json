The Lord was for them the Supreme Lordthe spiritual masterthe worshipable Deitythe guidethe chariot driverthe friendthe servantthe messenger and everything they could conceive of. And thus the Lord also reciprocated the feelings of the Pāṇḍavas. Mahārāja Parīkṣitas a pure devotee of the Lordcould appreciate the Lord's transcendental reciprocation of the feelings of His devoteesand thus he himself also was overwhelmed with the dealings of the Lord. Simply by appreciating the dealings of the Lord with His pure devoteesone can attain salvation. The Lord's dealings with His devotees appear to be ordinary human dealingsbut one who knows them in truth becomes at once eligible to go back homeback to Godhead. The Pāṇḍavas were so malleable to the will of the Lord that they could sacrifice any amount of energy for the service of the Lordand by such unalloyed determination they could secure the Lord's mercy in any shape they desired."
