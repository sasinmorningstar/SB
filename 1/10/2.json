Similarlyin the material world the wrath of those who want to lord it over material nature interactsand the fire of war takes placeexhausting the unwanted population. Such fires or wars take placeand the Lord has nothing to do with them. But because He wants to maintain the creationHe desires the mass of people to follow the right path of self-realizationwhich enables the living beings to enter into the kingdom of God. The Lord wants the suffering human beings to come back homeback to Himand cease to suffer the threefold material pangs. The whole plan of creation is made in that wayand one who does not come to his senses suffers in the material world by pangs inflicted by the illusory energy of the Lord. The Lord therefore wants His bona fide representative to rule the world. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa descended to establish this sort of regime and to kill the unwanted persons who have nothing to do with His plan. The Battle of Kurukṣetra was fought according to the plan of the Lord so that undesirable persons could get out of the world and a peaceful kingdom under His devotee could be established. The Lord was therefore fully satisfied when King Yudhiṣṭhira was on the throne and the seedling of the dynasty of Kuruin the person of Mahārāja Parīkṣitwas saved."
