This custom was observed even during the days of the Mahābhāratai.e.more than five thousand years ago. It is only the less intelligent persons not well versed in the history of the world who say that observance of separation of female from male is an introduction of the Mohammedan period in India. This incident from the Mahābhārata period proves definitely that the ladies of the palace observed strict pardā (restricted association with men)and instead of coming down in the open air where Lord Kṛṣṇa and others were assembledthe ladies of the palace went up on the top of the palace and from there paid their respects to Lord Kṛṣṇa by showers of flowers. It is definitely stated here that the ladies were smiling there on the top of the palacechecked by shyness. This shyness is a gift of nature to the fair sexand it enhances their beauty and prestigeeven if they are of a less important family or even if they are less attractive. We have practical experience of this fact. A sweeper woman commanded the respect of many respectable gentlemen simply by manifesting a lady's shyness. Half-naked ladies in the street do not command any respectbut a shy sweeper's wife commands respect from all."

The material beauty of a woman is an illusion because actually the body is made of earthwaterfireairetc. But because there is the association of the living spark with matterit appears to be beautiful. No one is attracted by an earthen dolleven if it is most perfectly prepared to attract the attention of others. The dead body has no beauty because no one will accept the dead body of a so-called beautiful woman. Thereforethe conclusion is that the spirit spark is beautifuland because of the soul's beauty one is attracted by the beauty of the outward body. The Vedic wisdomthereforeforbids us to be attracted by false beauty. But because we are now in the darkness of ignorancethe Vedic civilization allows very restricted mixing of woman and man. They say that the woman is considered to be the fireand the man is considered to be the butter. The butter must melt in association with fireand therefore they may be brought together only when it is necessary. And shyness is a check to the unrestricted mixing. It is nature's giftand it must be utilized."
