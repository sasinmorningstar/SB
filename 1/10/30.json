As soon as the devotees surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord sincerelythe Lord accepts themand thus the devotees at once become free from all material contaminations. Such devotees are above the three modes of material nature. There is no bodily disqualification of a devoteejust as there is no qualitative difference between the Ganges water and the filthy drain water when they are amalgamated. Womenmerchants and laborers are not very intelligentand thus it is very difficult for them to understand the science of God or to be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. They are more materialisticand less than them are the KirātasHūṇasĀndhrasPulindasPulkaśasĀbhīrasKaṅkasYavanasKhasasetc.but all of them can be delivered if they are properly engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. By engagement in the service of the Lordthe designative disqualifications are removedand as pure souls they become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God."
