In those days the King of Hastināpura (now part of New Delhi) was the emperor of the worldincluding the seasup to the time of Mahārāja Parīkṣitthe grandson of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's younger brothers were acting as his ministers and commanders of stateand there was full cooperation between the perfectly religious brothers of the King. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was the ideal king or representative of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa to rule over the kingdom of earth and was comparable to King Indrathe representative ruler of the heavenly planets. The demigods like IndraCandraSūryaVaruṇa and Vāyu are representative kings of different planets of the universeand similarly Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was also one of themruling over the kingdom of the earth. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was not a typically unenlightened political leader of modern democracy. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was instructed by Bhīṣmadeva and the infallible Lord alsoand therefore he had full knowledge of everything in perfection."

            "text": "The modern elected executive head of a state is just like a puppet because he has no kingly power. Even if he is enlightened like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhirahe cannot do anything out of his own good will due to his constitutional position. Thereforethere are so many states over the earth quarreling because of ideological differences or other selfish motives. But a king like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira had no ideology of his own. He had but to follow the instructions of the infallible Lord and the Lord's representative and the authorized agentBhīṣmadeva. It is instructed in the śāstras that one should follow the great authority and the infallible Lord without any personal motive and manufactured ideology. Thereforeit was possible for Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to rule the whole worldincluding the seasbecause the principles were infallible and universally applicable to everyone. The conception of one world state can only be fulfilled if we can follow the infallible authority. An imperfect human being cannot create an ideology acceptable to everyone. Only the perfect and the infallible can create a program which is applicable at every place and can be followed by all in the world. It is the person who rulesand not the impersonal government. If the person is perfectthe government is perfect. If the person is a foolthe government is a fool's paradise. That is the law of nature. There are so many stories of imperfect kings or executive heads. Thereforethe executive head must be a trained person like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhiraand he must have the full autocratic power to rule over the world. The conception of a world state can take shape only under the regime of a perfect king like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. The world was happy in those days because there were kings like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to rule over the world."
