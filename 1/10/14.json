When they saw that Kṛṣṇa was going away from the palace for His native placethey were very anxious for Himand as usual tears began to roll down their cheeks. They thoughtat the same timethat tears at that moment might be a cause of misfortune for Kṛṣṇa; therefore they wanted to check them. This was very difficult for them because the tears could not be checked. Thereforethey smeared their tears in their eyesand their hearts throbbed. Therefore ladies who were the wives and daughters-in-law of those who died in the battlefield never came in direct contact with Kṛṣṇa. But all of them heard of Him and His great activitiesand thus they thought of Himtalked of HimHis namefameetc.and became affectionate alsolike those who were in direct contact. Therefore directly or indirectly anyone who thinks of Kṛṣṇatalks of Kṛṣṇa or worships Kṛṣṇa becomes attached to Him. Because Kṛṣṇa is absolutethere is no difference between His nameformqualityetc. Our intimate relation with Kṛṣṇa can be confidentially revived by our talking ofhearing ofor remembering Him. It is so done due to spiritual potency."
