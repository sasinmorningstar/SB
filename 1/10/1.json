Thus he was not at all inclined to fight with his cousins for the sake of enjoying the kingdom: he fought for the right cause because the kingdom of Hastināpura was his rightful inheritance and his cousins wanted to usurp it for themselves. He foughtthereforefor the right cause under the guidance of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇabut he could not enjoy the results of his victory because his cousins were all killed in the fight.
