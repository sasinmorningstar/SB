The nitya-muktas are eternally liberated soulsand they are eternally engaged in the reciprocation of transcendental loving service with the Lord in His eternal abode beyond the manifested mundane creations. But the nitya-baddhaor eternally conditioned soulsare entrusted to His external energymāyāfor rectification of their rebellious attitude toward the Supreme Father. Nitya-baddhas are eternally forgetful of their relation with the Lord as parts and parcels. They are bewildered by the illusory energy as products of matterand thus they are very busy in making plans in the material world for becoming happy. They go on merrily with plansbut by the will of the Lord both the planmakers and the plans are annihilated at the end of a certain periodas above mentioned. This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gītā as follows: \"O son of Kuntīat the end of the millennium all the living entities merge into My natureand again when the time of creation is ripeI begin creation by the agency of My external energy.\" "

He is the cause of everything. But the living beingswho are constitutionally the parts and parcels of the Lord and are forgetful of the sweet relationare given a chance again to get rid of the clutches of the external energy. And to revive his (the living being's) consciousnessthe revealed scriptures are also created by the Lord. Vedic literatures are the guiding directions for the conditioned souls so they can get free from the repetition of creation and annihilation of the material world and the material body."

But in order to fulfill their desire to lord it over the material energy of material forms and namesthey are given a chance for such false enjoymentand at the same time they are given a chance to understand the real position through the revealed scriptures. The foolish and forgetful living being is always busy with false forms and false names. Modern nationalism is the culmination of such false names and false forms. Men are mad after false name and form. The form of body obtained under certain conditions is taken up as factualand the name also taken bewilders the conditioned soul into misusing the energy in the name of so many \"isms.\" The scriptureshoweversupply the clue for understanding the real positionbut men are reluctant to take lessons from the scriptures created by the Lord for different places and times. For examplethe Bhagavad-gītā is the guiding principle for every human beingbut by the spell of material energy they do not take care to carry out the programs of life in terms of the Bhagavad-gītā. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is the post-graduate study of knowledge for one who has thoroughly understood the principles of the Bhagavad-gītā. Unfortunately people have no taste for themand therefore they are under the clutches of māyā for repetition of birth and death."
