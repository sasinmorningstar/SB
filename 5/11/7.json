Learned scholars say that bodily appearance, bondage and liberation are caused by the mind.\n\n",

When the mind is engaged in the Lord's service (sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ  when the mind and senses are purified, one's total existence is purified, and one's designations are also purified. One no longer considers himself a human being, a demigod, cat, dog, Hindu, Muslim and so forth. When the senses and mind are purified and one is fully engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, one can be liberated and return home, back to Godhead."
