            "text": "A yogī empowered to select the moment of leaving his body can cause it to burst into flames by engaging in the yogic meditation called āgneyī, and thus he passes into his next life. The demigods similarly employ this mystic fire when being transferred to the spiritual world. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely different from conditioned souls like yogīs and demigods, since the Lord's eternal, spiritual body is the source of all existence, as indicated here by the words lokābhirāmāṁ sva-tanum. Lord Kṛṣṇa's body is the source of pleasure for the entire universe. The word dhāraṇā-dhyāna-maṅgalam indicates that those trying for spiritual elevation through meditation and yoga achieve all auspiciousness through meditation on the Lord's body. Since yogīs are liberated simply by thinking of Lord Kṛṣṇa's body, that body is certainly not material and therefore not subject to burning by mundane mystic fire or any other type of fire."

            "text": "Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura reminds us of Lord Kṛṣṇa's statement in the Eleventh Canto, : vahni-madhye smared rūpaṁ mamaitad dhyāna-maṅgalam. \"Within the fire one should meditate upon My form, which is the auspicious object of all meditation.\" Since Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental form is present within fire as the maintaining principle, how can fire affect that form? Thus although the Lord appeared to enter the mystic yoga trance, the word adagdhvā indicates that the Lord, since His body is purely spiritual, bypassed the formality of burning and directly entered His own abode in the spiritual sky. This point has also been elaborately explained by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī in his commentary to this verse."
