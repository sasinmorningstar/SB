Apparently this prostitute was so foolish that she maintained a romantic conception of her profession and was actually trying to enjoy loving affairs with her customers, not realizing that they were the lowest of men with the most abominable motives. Like the prostitute Piṅgalā, one should understand that by giving up the devotional service of the Lord one simply becomes a victim of the illusory energy and suffers greatly."
