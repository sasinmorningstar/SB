However, without developing a taste for chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord (śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ ), it is not possible to achieve the perfect liberation of going back home, back to Godhead. Therefore, on the Maharloka planet the unsuccessful sage gives more attention to chanting and hearing, and thus he gradually develops pure love of Godhead."
