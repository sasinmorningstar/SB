That the Lord is supreme is confirmed in the previous verse by the words padam śreṣṭhaṁ vidur mama. One may perform penances or visit holy places with a proud menta!ity or material motivation; similarly, one may chant prayers to God, give charity or perform other externally pious activities with many bizarre, hypocritical or even demoniac motivations. Realized knowledge of the supremacy of Lord Kṛṣṇa, however, is a solid connection with the spiritual world, and if one pursues this holy understanding one is gradually promoted to the highest level of conscious existence, called Vaikuṇṭha, or the kingdom of God."
