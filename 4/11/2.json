Kṛṣṇa consciousness and māyā are always there, side by side. As soon as there is awakening of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all the illusory pains and pleasures of material existence are vanquished. Māyām etāṁ taranti te:  constant chanting of the mahā-mantra will keep us always aloof from the illusory energy of māyā."
