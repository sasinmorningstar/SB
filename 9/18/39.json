Sex and sense gratification can be controlled, however, and one achieves perfection when he has no desires for sex. This is possible only when one is fully Kṛṣṇa conscious."

As long as one has desires for sex, one must change his body and transmigrate from one body to another to enjoy sex in different species or forms. But although the forms may differ, the business of sex is the same. Therefore it is said, punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām . Those who are very much attached to sex transmigrate from one body to another, with the same business of \"chewing the chewed,\" tasting sex enjoyment as a dog, sex enjoyment as a hog, sex enjoyment as a demigod, and so on."
