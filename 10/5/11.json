Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has also described Kṛṣṇa in this way: ramyā kācid upāsanā vrajavadhū-vargeṇa yā kalpitā. All these gopīs were going to offer Kṛṣṇa their presentations because the gopīs are eternal associates of the Lord. Now the gopīs were more jubilant because of the news of Kṛṣṇa's appearance in Vṛndāvana."
