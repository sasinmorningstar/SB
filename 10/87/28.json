    "translation": "\nThough You have no material senses, You are the self-effulgent sustainer of everyone's sensory powers. The demigods and material nature herself offer You tribute, while also enjoying the tribute offered them by their worshipers, just as subordinate rulers of various districts in a kingdom offer tribute to their lord, the ultimate proprietor of the land, while also enjoying the tribute paid them by their own subjects. In this way the universal creators faithfully execute their assigned services out of fear of You.\n\n",

Especially since as the Supersoul in every being's heart I supervise countless organs and limbs, how am I not implicated in the sum total of everyone's sense gratification?\" \"No,\" the assembled śrutis here rejoin, \"You have no material senses, yet You are the absolute controller of all.\" As expressed in the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad (3.18),"
