Dharmān refers to the Manu-saṁhitā and other standard lawbooks (dharma-śāstras). Nyāya-pathān refers to the doctrine of Karma-mīmāṁsā and other such theories. Ānvīkṣikīm is knowledge of the techniques of logical argument (tarka). The sixfold political science is quite pragmatic and includes (1) sandhi, making peace; (2) vigraha, war; (3) yāna, marching; (4) āsana, sitting tight; (5) dvaidha, dividing one's forces; and (6) saṁśaya, seeking the protection of a more powerful ruler."
