It should be remembered that in the Vedic context kāla, or time, does not refer merely to a system of measuring planetary movements such as days, weeks, months and years but rather to the way things are being moved. Everything is moving according to its destiny, and this destiny is also described as \"time,\" since everyone's destiny is revealed and imposed by the movements of time."
