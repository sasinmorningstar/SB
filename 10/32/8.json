The ācārya quotes a verse from the Śrī Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī that gives the names of these seven as Candrāvalī, Śyāmalā, Śaibyā, Padmā, Śrī Rādhā, Lalitā and Viśākhā. The eighth is understood to be Bhadrā. Śrī Vaiṣṇava-toṣaṇī itself quotes a verse from the Skanda Purāṇa that declares these eight gopīs to be the principal among the three billion gopīs. Detailed information about the hierarchy of gopīs is available in Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī's Ujjvala-nīlamaṇi."
