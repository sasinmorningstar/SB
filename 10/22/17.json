If they delayed any longer, they thought, some other man might come along, and this would be unbearable for them. The gopīs loved Kṛṣṇa so much that even in that awkward situation their attachment to Him was increasing more and more, and they were very eager to stay in His company. Thus they did not even consider drowning themselves in the river because of the embarrassing situation."
