Also, the pride of the gopīs was a pretense created by Kṛṣṇa's pastime potency in order to intensify their love for Him through separation. In this connection, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī quotes Bharata Muni's Nāṭyaśāstra: na vinā vipralambhena sambhogaḥ puṣṭim aśnute. \"Direct contact is not fully appreciated until separation has been experienced.\""
