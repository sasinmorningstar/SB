            "text": "According to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, this verse summarizes the knowledge presented in this section of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Lord Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet are described as pallava, flower buds, because they are most tender and of a pinkish hue. According to Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, the word pallava also indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet are just like desire trees, which can fulfill all the desires of the Lord's pure devotees. Even exalted devotees like Śrī Nārada, who are themselves the great shelter for the conditioned souls in this universe, personally take shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Thus it is natural that when Lord Kṛṣṇa manifested Himself as all the young boys and calves of Vṛndāvana, their parents were more attracted to them than previously. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all pleasure and, being all-attractive, the ultimate object of everyone's love."
