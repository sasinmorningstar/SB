To increase population, he then created woman from the better half of man's body, for woman's behavior carries away a man's mind.\n\n",

Therefore the words ekānta-bhūtāni, which are used here, indicate that to avoid sexual desires one should avoid the company of women as far as possible. Sexual desire is so powerful that one is saturated with it if he stays in a solitary place with any woman, even his mother, sister or daughter."
