Any material \"charitable\" arrangement will inevitably be crushed by the onward march of time. Thus only realization of one's eternal existence beyond the reach of time can make one fearless, and only freedom from material desire constitutes real freedom, for it enables one to escape the bondage of the laws of nature. Therefore real charity is to help people revive their eternal, spiritual consciousness."

The qualities mentioned here—truthfulness, mercy, austerity and charity—are universal, nonsectarian aspects of pious life."
