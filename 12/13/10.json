Also, the first verse of the Bhāgavatam states, tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye:  \"Lord Kṛṣṇa expanded perfect knowledge into the heart of Lord Brahmā.\" Because conditioned souls can experience only temporary objects, which are created, maintained and destroyed, they cannot readily understand that Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is an eternal, transcendental literature nondifferent from the Absolute Truth."

To his eldest son, Atharvā, He instructed the spiritual science of the self, which is the basis of all other branches of knowledge.\" Despite his exalted position, however, Brahmā still fears the influence of the Lord's illusory potency. Thus this energy seems virtually insurmountable. But Lord Caitanya is so kind that during His missionary activities in eastern and southern India, He freely distributed Kṛṣṇa consciousness to everyone, urging them to become teachers of Bhagavad-gītā. Lord Caitanya, who is Kṛṣṇa Himself, encouraged the people by saying, \"By My order just become a teacher of Lord Kṛṣṇa's message and save this country. I assure you that the waves of māyā will never stop your progress.\" "
