This project is an attempt to parse the primary contents of the "BHAGAVATA PURANA", one of the 18 Maha Puranas.
The text for this project is collected from the Vanipedia Project that is available on the Internet for everyone to benefit from.

The idea is to parse the specific contents of the Bhagavata Purana i.e. the "Verse", "Synonym", "Translation" and "Purport" into the JSON format
which can then be used for specific purposes including API consumption to cater to specific needs.
